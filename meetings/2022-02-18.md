  * lazy loading?
  * [Defects](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/labels/Defect)

## Topics

- [name=Mridul] Submit applications for Outreachy and GSoC.
    - Started the applications for both.
    - Current mentor roster: Dan, Ross, Mridul
    - We shouldn't aim for more than 1.5x student to mentor ratio.
        - One slot for Outreachy
        - 1-2 for GSoC
        - (this is assuming we get in)
    - Project ideas:
      * New layouts
      * Other graph polynomials

    - https://discuss.scientific-python.org/

- [name=Jarrod] https://libraries.io/pypi/networkx

- [name=Jarrod] matching for 2.7?
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4897
      * Rebase to get rid of sphinx error 
- [name=Dan] https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5265 would require a new dependency on sympy. Is that a problem?
  * Seems like there are other graph polynomials as well - will those be added?

- Linting - should we add more linters?

- [name=Ross] support for `numpy.random.Generator` in `create*random_state` and associated decorators
  * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5336
  * Related issue/discussion: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4891
  * Step 1: add support for `numpy.random.Generator` (hopefully for 2.7)
  * Step 2: replace `RandomState` with `Generator` as the default random interface in NX 3.0
    - Will definitely require a NXEP!


- [name=Mridul] Respond to https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/5326 ( nx.info )
  * [name=Jarrod] Idea: deprecate `nx.info`, which is now redundant given `Graph.__str__`
  * Add a new method `Graph.describe` for more detailed info
    - name `describe` borrowed from pd.DataFrame API

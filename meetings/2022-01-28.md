## Welcome and news

## Important dates/deadlines

## News

- NetworkX weekly dev meetings have now moved to Fridays 17:30 GMT. 

## Follow-up from last week

- NX tutorial for IMSI
  * Aurora responded on networkx.groups.io
    - Audience appears to be mostly grad-level
    - Expect some Python familiarity but more of a C++/Fortran crowd
    - Will be virtual
    - No particular preference for a tutorial or more hands-on interactive session (if it can be pulled of virtually)
    - Dataset (?)
    - Other projects giving tutorials: *We have TTK, Scikit-TDA, Bayes-TDA, ChemNetworks and hopefully NetworkX*
  * Sounds good! Mridul will reply and introduce himself, start working out logistics
  * Time slot: 7:30 AM - Noon PDT, March 1st
  
- Lazy importing follow-up: do we want to try for 2.7?
    - [name=Dan] to follow up on PR.
        - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4909
        - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5242
          * Move imports that are internal to functions out to the top and lazy import them instead
          * PR #2: lazy load modules like `approximations` and `bipartite` - stay tuned
          

- Financials:
  * NumFOCUS has responded: our individual donations (3 so far) have shown up in their system internally, but they don't have a system in place yet to guarantee that they get to our P&L documents. So individual donations *work* we just may not be able to see them reliably for now.
  * Give the numfocus typeform a try for submitting invoices as well
  * Also: double-check the stipend donation from scipy conference tutorial

- Ross talked about getting questions asked about github actions. https://github.com/scientific-python/devstats.scientific-python.org

## Topics

 - Basic intro to the decorator replacement: `argmap`
   The idea is to go through the methods of the `argmap` class      and have Kelly describe what each does.
   * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4739
  Traits of this argmap approach:
    - goal is to maintain the function signature of the original
      decorated function. which is hard to do with a simple 
      inline functuon while munging the arguments.
  Additions that would be helpful:
     - Add examples that use the arguments of `nodes_or_numbers`.
     - Perhaps go through and change decorators that exist to use
  the name of the input parameter rather than the index of the     parameter.
     - Check that the random_state decorator
     https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/new-or-different.html#new-or-different
     - fill out docstrings with short description of motivation
     of each method.
     - flesh out functions in the short sweet class-level examples.
     - see how the traceback from a raised error looks.

 - Should better handling of node shape in GraphML/yED be part of 2.6 or wait? #4694
   * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4694
 - What to do about bad import patterns?
   * Technically a breaking change - warn for a cycle first?
       * It seems like a bug to me (JM), so according to our policy we don't need a warning.
   * How common are these patterns?
     - [`from networkx import networkx`](https://github.com/search?q=%22from+networkx+import+networkx%22&type=code)
        * Doesn't seem that bad - lots of false positives
     - [`from networkx import nx`](https://github.com/search?q=%22from+networkx+import+nx%22&type=code)
        * More instances but many from ppl committing their `venv`s which include an nx-2.5 gallery example with this bad import pattern
        * No repos/code with more than 5 forks
        * https://github.com/search?l=&q=%22from+networkx+import+networkx%22+forks%3A%3E5&type=code
        * https://github.com/search?q=%22from+networkx+import+nx%22+forks%3A%3E5&type=code
    * JM thinks we should wait until a new release of
        * https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-lint/pull/2035
        * they seem to release every few weeks (it has been a week since the last release)
    * JM cleaned up our old docs (the source of the confusion, I believe)
        * https://github.com/networkx/documentation/commit/2fd6268885e160996bd60f9fe67602826d50b237

# NetworkX Developer Discussions:  July 16, 2020

In attendance: Aric Hagberg, Jarrod Millman, Dan Schult, Ross Barnowski, Eric Ma, Mridul Seth

1. Introductions

2. Long form narrative
  - https://github.com/networkx/notebooks
  - http://ericmjl.github.io/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple/
  - should we make Network-Analysis-Made-Simple the basis of long form?
  - if so, should it move to networkx org? (w/ Eric as owner)

Ross will start looking at it to get up to speed w/ Network Analysis and
he will investigate where new machinery may help.
Eric will think more about what he wants to do with NAMS and its future.

4. Triage

  - old issues / PRs to prioritize
  - mark as others as draft
    - add explanation (e.g., needs docs, tests, refactor, etc.)
    - rebase first (core developers) not to master

We will all try to grab a few old issues/PRs when you can over the
next few weeks.

5. Virtual Sprint
  - how did the scipy sprint go?
  - who would be able to participate?

We will propose some "private" Friday sprints next week.
Community sprints will come later.

  - 2.5 September (all deprecations in)
  - 3.0 January
  - 3.1 May
  - possible API changes (start keeping notes)

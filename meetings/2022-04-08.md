## Important dates/deadlines


- NX 2.8 (4/4/22)
  * rc1 on 4/4/22
  * Release today? (4/8)
- NX 3.0 (5/31/22)

TODO: Fix Grey/Green checkmark problem on GH!

## Topics

- metagraph-algorithms https://github.com/metagraph-dev/graphblas-algorithms
    - for larger graphs, it can be upto 10-20x faster than scipy.sparse!
    - It also works super well for dense graphs (compared to scipy.sparse)
    - Using the [NX-API-sandbox](https://github.com/MridulS/nx-api-sandbox), dispatching to scipy (scipy.sparse as the graph object) vs grblas(grblas.Matrix as the graph object)![](https://i.imgur.com/0WuBsNR.png)

- Public keys on GitHub!

    - Explicitly mention which key is used to sign the releases, https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/2850


- [name=Ross] Migration guide
  - [ ] https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/doc/release/migration_guide_from_2.x_to_3.0.rst
It would be good to at least hightlight a few things now. In particular, discussing sparse array stuff.
  - [ ] more deprecation opportunities
  - [ ] clean up/improve our tests
  - [name=rossbar] Will finish the numpy/scipy blurbs today (4/8)

- Outreachy and GSoC
  * Thanks Mridul for the awesome setup!
    - Lot's of interactions with new contributors, I think the "scaffolding" that has been set up to guide them through setup is great (and should probably be used in more projects)
    - how much doc churn do we want
    - What happens if we want multiple folks to work with us during Outreachy? There are multiple folks already who have created nice PRs to the outreachy repo.
  * GSoC - Applications are open, we do have a bunch of applications already submitted. Do we have final number of folks we want to mentor this summer?
      * We have one slot of Outreachy
      * Maximum 2 with GSoC?
      

 - Nvidia email response
   * [name=rossbar] Find & copy over numpy's policy for discussion
   * Open a topic on discuss.scientific-python.org?

 - NumFOCUS moved to Open Collective - they asked for feedback during the project call - some projects aren't too excited by the transparent ledger for all sort of funds/transcations held/done by the project.
 - Open 
 
- Rename all networkx exceptions: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/1705
  * Removed the "needs PR" label
  * What's the benefit? The motivation seemst to be consistency with other projects, but at this point breaking the pattern will be pretty disruptive for users... IMO this would need more concrete motivation.
  * [name=rossbar] - summarize discussion and close. Generally summary:
    - Doesn't seem to be any intrinsic beneifit of this renaming
    - From Kelly: there's a way to do this refactor without breaking backward compatibility. *If* you were going to do it, this is the right way, but still not much motivation for the change.

## Long-term tracking items

- Temporal networks: how to think about these
  * seems to be a lot of interest from different communities, but no standard approach yet...
  * Having a use-case to drive the design of a data structure would be good
  
- Stop building/shipping pdf version of documentation?
  * This is being considered by both scipy and numpy and seems to have garnered mostly positive feedback
    - related scipy issue: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/15635
  * revisit after 2.8 release
  * Keep up-to-date with feedback from other projects that are considering this

Previous meeting notes available [here](https://github.com/networkx/archive/tree/main/meetings). Please feel free to add topics for discussion and news items below.

**In attendance:** Dimitris, Matt, Ross, Mridul, Dan, Jarrod

## Welcome and news

## Important dates/deadlines

- NX2.7 (2/21/22) and 3.0 (5/31/22)

## News

- NetworkX weekly dev meetings have now moved to Fridays 17:30 GMT. 

## Follow-up from last week

- Invitation from Aurora Clark (Wash. St. Univ.) to a workshop entitled “The Mathematics of Soft Matter” (by IMSI). This workshop is bringing mathematicians, chemists and materials scientists to discuss the challenges, tools and opportunities for better integrating methods like graph theory and topological data analysis to study soft matter systems.

  It includes a software training session where 3-4 different code developer teams give 1-2 hour presentations that go over the capabilities and some use cases of their codes. This would be the week of Feb 28 – March 4, but is tentatively set for the morning of Feb 29.  
  - Email has been forwarded to groups.io
  - Think about participating in this: what do they want? What will the audience be?
    - Followup with organizers [name=mridul,jarrod]
  - Dan reached out, waiting for a response. 
  
- hackmd: add NX team to Scientific Python team on hackmd [name=Stefan,Jarrod]
  * Turns out the scientific-python team on hackmd can only have 20 people, so this solution doesn't scale
  * Stick with status quo for now (just have to remember to archive promptly)
  * Investigate OSS self-hosted alternative: https://hedgedoc.org/

- Financial stuff
  * Check on P&L spreadsheet in NumFOCUS shared drive [name=Ross]
    * Still no info about the GH donations - will ping in January
    * Checked on 21/01 - no update on a P&L Sheet yet
  * Tidelift followup [name=Dan] -- they have not been responding.
    * No response on our request to become a lifter though...
    * https://libraries.io/pypi/networkx
        * says our current release is 0.33
        * Jarrod has tried contacting them several times (no response)
    * CVE's have gotten a bit more annoying for NumPy

- Lazy importing follow-up: do we want to try for 2.7?
    - [name=Dan] to follow up on PR.
        - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4909
        - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5242

- [name=Mridul] CZI grant Q1 2022 goals/plans.  https://github.com/MridulS/NetworkXCZIEOSS4/issues
    - Will make this private again, add nx-devs to this repo.

- Ross talked about getting questions asked about github actions. https://github.com/rossbar/github_graphql/

- Refactoring `to_numpy_array`: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5250
  * A new implementation that complete decouples edge processing from numpy array insertion
    - Allows full-fledged dtype support (e.g. complex weights, which was the motivating use-case raised by user `adeak`)
      * This includes structured dtypes! Could investigate deprecating `to_numpy_recarray`...
    - Enables arbitrary reduction functions for `multiweight_edges`
      * Currently, only (`sum`, `min`, and `max` are explicitly allowed)
      * functions like `mean` or `median` didn't used to work because array was updated by weights iteratively (they do now)
    - Downside: about 50% slower for large, dense (worst case == complete) graphs; (however, new implementation is faster than old for sparser graphs)
  * Question: are these tradeoffs reasonable?

- [name=Mridul] A PoC of a multi dispatch API system
    - https://github.com/MridulS/nx-api-sandbox
    - Next steps: Use csgraph algorithms with NX API dispatch https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.csgraph.html

# NetworkX Developer Discussions: November 11th, 2021
Previous meeting notes available [here](https://github.com/networkx/archive/tree/master/meetings). Please feel free to add topics for discussion and news items below.

**In attendance:** Jarrod, Dimitris, Mridul, Dan, Ross

## Welcome and news

## Important dates/deadlines

- NX2.7 (12/31/21) and 3.0 (2/28/22)

## Topics

- New algorithms implementations: What should go in?
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/5164
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/4808
    - How do other projects deal with this?
        - scikit-learn https://scikit-learn.org/stable/faq.html#why-are-you-so-selective-on-what-algorithms-you-include-in-scikit-learn, https://scikit-learn.org/stable/faq.html#what-are-the-inclusion-criteria-for-new-algorithms
    - Could this be something of a wider interest? like a post on scientific-python discourse?

- CZI
  * EOSS conference: interesting things you learned last week?
  * Grant paperwork status check

- GitHub "Sponsor this project" enabled
  * Test donation in the pipeline - how do we check our account? [name=Ross]
  
- Matplotlib 3.5.0rc1 breaks `nx_pylab`: updates
  * Fixed - matplotlib also reverted the change + added deprecation period, so no backports necessary on our part.

- Negative cycle detection in `bellman_ford`: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5089
  * Merged!

- Interesting behavior in Louvain: sensitivity to node ordering? https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/5175
  * From the literature (thx Dimitris!) seems like this might be expected
  
- Follow-up on proposed reachability module: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5042
  * We punked ourselves a bit with merge order, leading to a tricky conflict that will need a careful rebase
  * Worth the effort to help clarify e.g. https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5176


- Running a more involved sprint with folks from Data Umbrella. If not a NetworkX specific sprint, a broad "scientific python" sprint?
    - https://afme2021.dataumbrella.org (scikit-learn)
    - https://pymc-data-umbrella.xyz/en/latest/ (pymc)
  * Jarrod + Mridul will follow up (January?)



## PR review

There are a couple quick merges (I think) that need a second set of :eyes:
 - [ ] [#5086: Fix bug in lowest_common_ancestors](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5086)
   * This one may have an interesting opportunity for a little research project if anyone's interested. See the discussion in #4942, particularly [here](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4942#issuecomment-873127745)


## Discussion

What goes into NetworkX (see first topic):
  - published + cited, similar to scikit-learn's policy, are nice filters
  - Cases where NX has pushed back against including things:
    * Visualization (nx-viz), but this isn't really algorithms
    * Expanding dependencies (pandas, xarray, etc.)
  - General sense: relaxed over rigid
  - Should we add a list of algorithms that we *really* want
    * A user survey might be useful here!
  - Add bullet to contributor FAQ: point to mission & values

Louvain:
  - Original c++ implementation: shuffling only at the beginning (but this is for undirected case only)
  - Paper indicates that order is important (and future work)
  - Shuffling after each step could fix the problem, but need to be sure not originating from

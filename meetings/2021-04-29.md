**In attendance:**

### GSoC

Primary mentor has to write mid-summer review. (This sounds like a form to fill in.)

We should probably have a kick-off meeting. The weekly NX meeting is probably the best place for this. Good to have name-to-face, which can help lubricate the review process.

Action items:

1. [ ] Everyone click on the students they want to mentor.


------

CI has failed again because of Cartopy.

Move geospatial examples out of gallery and into a notebook. Not important to run CI. Now that there are notebooks, we should put them there. Image teaser linked out to actual notebook --> this would be a good example.

Documentation: top-level "applications", one example underneath, with a "see more here" link added.

Decorators: nothing done this week. Can start hacking on backlog on Sunday.
Need to time imports for profiling.

`create_using`. B-A graph PR.

Deprecations: found another function that inputs a dictionary that has two keys with two values for each of those keys. Need to look for more of these. Came up because someone ran a code linter. Caught and fixed cytoscape one, there's another one in json_graph r/w.

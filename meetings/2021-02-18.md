**NOTE:** if we add the pytest-randomly scheduled workflow, the following badge should show the current status ->
![pytest-randomly status](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/workflows/.github/workflows/pytest-randomly.yml/badge.svg)

## Welcome and news

- NumFOCUS fiscal sponsorship agreement
  * Two things (see doc for details)
    - Have to have *both* NX & numfocus agree on successor org if we decide to leave numfocus.
    - Wording for "legal entity for negotiations" should include non-financial contracts too.

- GSoD: Apparently the new program *requires* an open collective account
  
- Conference proposals
  * Submitted talks about NX history/community building to scipy/pycon

## Topics

- Renaming default branch in repo from `master`->`main`
  * Use a smaller repo (pygraphviz) as a test case
  * Likely todos:
    - A bit closer monitoring of PRs to handle confusion
    - grepping docs for `master`->`main`

- Preparing for 2.6 release
  * NXEP 3 - edge list generation
    - Another round of updating the document
  * panther++
    - implications for panther API? Confirm this.
    - API would be the most important thing to get straightened out

- both missing png thumbnail in gallery
  * [Javascript gallery example](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4571)
    - Needs a utility drawing function; where should it go?
    - Emphasize that these plots work in Jupyter
    - Show how to customize the plots based on blocks.io examples
  * [Plotly gallery example](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4507)

- Major documentation revamps? https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs 
  - Ideas for GSoD
    * `networkx-notebooks`
    * Improved tutorial(s)
    * Move documentation from reference guide into the docstrings proper
  - Mridul will investigate some options; Ross will attend NumPy docs meeting on Monday and see what they're saying about the next round of GSoD

Merge/discuss PRs:
Review of test suite and coverage:
- [ ] TSP: Ross will convert comments -> PRs
- [ ] https://codecov.io/gh/networkx/networkx/src/master/networkx/algorithms/isomorphism/temporalisomorphvf2.py
- [ ] Testing for Union, compose, Euler path

## PRs that need an opinion

- https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4594
  Do we always want to build docs even when they're not modified?  Maybe, to see the gallery, e.g.
  But can at least avoid running tests in response to docs-only changes.

## Discussion

 - NX website landing page logo: add a more complex/meaningful graph? Ideas?
 
 - Other gallery examples
 - As many examples to other visualization libraries as possible
    * graphtool?
    * igraph (WIP)

 - **Action item**: Add a "visualization" category to GitHub discussions
   * Add the above bullet: projects we'd like gallery examples for
   * Add a bullet about gotchas/questions related to visualization
     - let's people know we're thinking about visualization
     - Good place to collect ideas for NXEPs/design docs etc.

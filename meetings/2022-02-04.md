- Lazy importing follow-up: do we want to try for 2.7?
    - [name=Dan] to follow up on PR.
        - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4909
        - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5242
          * Move imports that are internal to functions out to the top and lazy import them instead
          * PR #2: lazy load modules like `approximations` and `bipartite` - stay tuned
    - RE: lazy importing subpackges (e.g. `scipy.sparse`) - requires a centralized place to store what has been loaded, causes problems with lazy-loaded delayed import error. General consensus - let's push this off until later as benefit doesn't seem worth the amount of engineering required.
          

- Financials [name=Ross]
  * Give the numfocus typeform a try for submitting invoices as well
    - Have pinged about invoice approval, awaiting response
  * Everything is now accounted for in NumFOCUS spreadsheet (AFAWK) except the SciPy stipend - following up

- Harmonic "diameter"/centrality
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5251
    - Investigate comment about average path length
  * Will try to follow-up with this PR [name=Jarrod]

- Any thoughts on whether to add extendability module? https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4890
  * Seems to be well-established enough in literature - a bit more research to decide the best name
  - [x] Decide whether to include (consensus is: yes)
  - [ ] Decide what the API should be (func/module name, multiple functiosns?)
  - [ ] Final pass on implementation

- [name=Ross] Migration guide
  - [ ] https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/doc/release/migration_guide_from_2.x_to_3.0.rst
It would be good to at least hightlight a few things now. In particular, discussing sparse array stuff.
  - [ ] more deprecation opportunities
  - [ ] clean up/improve our tests

- [name=Jarrod] I have a personal list of various minor clean ups / documentation improvements

- [name=Mridul] Submit applications for Outreachy and GSoC.
    - Started the applications for both.
    - Current mentor roster: Dan, Ross, Mridul
    - We shouldn't aim for more than 1.5x student to mentor ratio.
        - One slot for Outreachy
        - 1-2 for GSoC
        - (this is assuming we get in)
    - Project ideas:
      * New layouts
      * Other graph polynomials
  - **NOTE**: Mentored project list should remain static during GSoC evaluation period. i.e. - don't add new projects until early March

- [name=Mridul] Respond to https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/5326 ( nx.info )
  - [x] [name=Jarrod] Idea: deprecate `nx.info`, which is now redundant given `Graph.__str__`
      * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5341
  * [ ] Add a new method `Graph.describe` for more detailed info
    - name `describe` borrowed from pd.DataFrame API
    

- [name=Ross] Activity in `scipy.sparse.csgraph` spectral embedding:
  * https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/15391
  * Related mailing list post: https://mail.python.org/archives/list/scipy-dev@python.org/thread/7JKMG6XSDGZRR2M5AVSHCA6KSLHVGOU7/

## Long-term tracking items

- Temporal networks: how to think about these
  * seems to be a lot of interest from different communities, but no standard approach yet...
  * Having a use-case to drive the design of a data structure would be good
  
- Stop building/shipping pdf version of documentation?
  * This is being considered by both scipy and numpy and seems to have garnered mostly positive feedback
    - related scipy issue: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/15635
  * revisit after 2.7 release
  * Keep up-to-date with feedback from other projects that are considering this


## Discussion

- [ ] Social media
    * NetworkX twitter
    * blog.scientific-python.org

- outreachy accepted
- GSoC
- numfocus / open collective in process

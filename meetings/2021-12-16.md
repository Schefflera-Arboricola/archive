Previous meeting notes available [here](https://github.com/networkx/archive/tree/master/meetings). Please feel free to add topics for discussion and news items below.

**In attendance:** Matt, Mridul, Ross, Dan, Jarrod

## Welcome and news

## Important dates/deadlines

- NX2.7 (1/31/22) and 3.0 (2/28/22)

## Topics

- meeting meta: hackmd shenanigans
  * Hackmd pulled a fast one and now you have to pay for some features (e.g. document history). We now have a "scientific Python" team on hackmd that should restore these features, but I'm not sure whether documents created under that team are visible to everyone: Please see if everyone can access the following link: https://hackmd.io/vUJ8Qj2NSb6jJscYcTlW2g
  * If the above works for everyone, I'll move these notes to that document (and update the hackmd link in the calendar)

- Financial stuff
  * Check on P&L spreadsheet in NumFOCUS shared drive [name=Ross]
    * Update: P&L for CZI is now available in the shared drive
    * Still no info about the GH donations - will ping about that again
  * Tidelift followup [name=Dan] -- they have not been responding.
    * I got an email this week from Tidelift laying out their plans for 2022 in [a video](https://forum.tidelift.com/t/tidelifts-vision-for-maintainers-in-2022/513). basicllay, they are looking to support maintainers more globally than just by paying them. Reduce noise, stress and work toward options that could e.g. provide benefits etc.
    * No response on our request to become a lifter though...

- `scipy.sparse` adoption
  * Returning sparse arrays is an API change: keep sparse matrices for 2.7 and add a `FutureWarning`, with full swap over to sparse array in 3.0?

- What to do about the `draw_<layout>` convenience functions in `nx_pylab`?
  * Opened a discussion topic: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/5220
  
- Documentation: switch from `nb2plots` to `myst-nb` to handle executable chunks in documentation?
  * "Executable chunks" == tutorial and introduction
  * Tested myst-nb in: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5221
  * Quick takeaways:
    - Requires executable files to be written in myst-markdown instead of rst (see diff)
    - Not quite ready on the LaTeX side (opened issue upstream)

- Lazy importing follow-up: do we want to try for 2.7?
    - [name=Dan] to follow up on PR.
    
- Fold normalization into `laplacian_matrix`: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/5193

- Scipy 1.8 has added user warnings to `lobpcg` when the iterations terminate before the desired tolerance is reached. I'm inclined to just silence them (scipy does this in its own test suite) but wanted to bring it up here in case someone wanted to take a closer look at `lobpcg` in `algebraicconnectivity`

- A neat repository of graphs that I learned about while reviewing [#5127](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5217): https://sparse.tamu.edu/. I'm sure some of you knew about this already, but sharing here because I thought it was cool!
  * A sparse matrix graph representation for every occasion :rocket:

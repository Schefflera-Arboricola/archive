## Welcome and news

- New Meeting time Thursdays at 6pm UTC.
- NX rc0 released Oct 6. 
- [Publicly available analytics for our docs pages](https://views.scientific-python.org/networkx.org) are now available! 
- Numfocus board elections

## Upcoming meetings
- Weekly meetings: hackmds for [nx-parallel](https://hackmd.io/vlGWcfRsQF64OTIm7bCtpw) and [dispatching](https://hackmd.io/rqs_pWMxSLmICXCpI3w-Ug)
- [PyData NYC Nov 6-8](https://ti.to/pydata/pydata-nyc-2024). Rick and Anthony and maybe Dan will attend Rick will be speaking Friday am.
- Lets get a NetworkX Meeting set for early 2025 or late 2024. Where?
- summit in Copenhagen funding didn't come through via Mridul's 1st attempt -- needs to be open to the public for that source.
- Maybe the NX summit could include other projects.

## 3.4 Release
- Timing
    - nice to have release before Oct 14 so Colab can include nx-cugraph in their default container.
        - RC0 Oct 6
        - Python release Oct 7
        - aim for release of NX3.4 after our meeting?
- Punch list (what is needed)
  - [x] https://github.com/networkx/networkx/milestone/32
  - [x] [PR 5672](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5672) `create_using` for random_graphs
  - [x] [PR 7565](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7565) with folow-up [PR 7652](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7565). Revisit kwargs for `node_link_data` functions
  - [x] [PR 7585](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7585) Dispatching refactor and declaring networkx as fallback backend. Merged! :tada:
- Things that should wait until after the release
    - Don't merge in new viz API before the release!
- Dropped matplotlib 3.6, next release 3.7. There might be things we could improve in the code using new features.
- Similar for Python release. Are we able to take advantage of new features?
- try to update scipy to not use scipy.sparse
    - $ grep -r csr_matrix scipy/

## Topics
- Increased volume of classwork/hacktoberfest style of PRs
  * Not much to do necessarily, other than be aware!
- Naming conventions for unaffiliated projects
  * NetworkX-Temporal on discussion mailing list
  * Invite author to come to this meeting soon.
- Replace kwarg `link` with `edges` [PR 7565](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7565)    merged :tada:
  * I think all items are in place for this. Are there other issues to handle?
      * In the end we added special-casing logic for `link` abd `edges` to raise specific exceptions that clearly state what the issue is (instead of a generic KeyError). Maybe we should have warned instead of raising...by we didn't this time.
- Visualization PRs:
    - Can we come up with a name for the `new_draw` function? 
        - `draw_nx`, `sketch`, `plot`, `show`, `new_draw`, `depict`, `see`, `viz`, `paint`, `display`, ~~`graph`~~, `visualize`, `render`, ...  Maybe look at GraVe
    - [#7571 Saving layouts on the graph](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7571) 
        - mutating the graphs by default goes against the [developer missions statement](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/developer/values.html)
        - Can we instead, include examples in the doc_strings which show how to set values on G?
        - We should comment in PR and change deprecation plans.
    - [#7589 Introducing the new_draw API](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7589)
        - What would be the deprecation warning and removal timing.
    - Proposal to leave the existing `draw` system while developing this new system as an alternative. Otherwise we will break many people's existing code without an obvious advantage to them other than the new design. 
        - New interface would be preferred, but not required.
        - New interface builds off data stored on the graph. Only inputs are the graph object and some attribute names?
        - Could this interface work to create pygraphviz, nydot or nxviz images?
        - Need a name for the new draw function
-    Benchmarking CI job
      * Tried it the other day, not sure if it's working: [logs](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/actions/runs/10364115584/job/28688937688?pr=7595)
      * [Another link to the logs](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/actions/workflows/benchmark.yml)
      * Derek has submitted a Small Developer Grant to NumFOCUS to support development of a benchmarking system that can compare Graph Algorithms across implementations! :tada:
      * Workflows: [nx](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/.github/workflows/benchmark.yml), [skimage](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/blob/main/.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml)
      * Keep in mind how to surface information from benchmarks to where that information makes a difference
- pygraphviz: Felipe from [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/pygraphviz-feedstock) has gotten us setup with `cibuildwheel` :rocket: 
  * Will merge after next pygraphviz release (early October)
  * Update?
- `create_using` as hook for external graph implementations
  * See e.g. [#5762](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5672) for the random_graph generators. Merged :tada:
  * If users have external `Graph` that implement the subset of methods necessary for various generators in NetworkX, they should be able to pass their class into `create_using` and get one of their objects out
    - Supporting this adds a little boilerplate on NX's end; i.e. needing to check whether `create_using` is directed/multi for creation functions that don't support those types. Here's an [example](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/409979eff35f02eff54f4eea3731736bd431dc2e/networkx/generators/classic.py#L547-L551). #5762 created a helper function [check_create_using](https://github.com/tillahoffmann/networkx/blob/b11c8fdd0934645c14ebe88b17f4b461d0e4b5e7/networkx/utils/misc.py#L604) in utils.py to do this processing so it is easy to implement across all random_graph.py functions.
    - Still need to:
      * wrap this boilerplate into a decorator similar to `not_implemented_for`.
      * Don't need to handle all of these in one giant PR! But maybe could... :)
* Should we raise a NetworkXError instead of a ValueError.
      - Should write that down somewhere
      - If error nx is creating, it's an NXError (vs SciPy, re-using ValueError, e.g.)
      - Some exceptions such as NodeNotFound, NXPointlessConcept etc.
    * could make it a decorator (in a different PR) But there might be many subtle cases.
    * python 3.11
        * https://peps.python.org/pep-0654/
        * https://peps.python.org/pep-0678/
- Temporal Graphs
    - [networkx-temporal](https://networkx-temporal.readthedocs.io/) was recently released and looks like nice documentation and [github pages](https://pypi.org/p/networkx-temporal). Functionality is manipulating time-slices and static representations of the dynamic graphs, and computing static measures for snapshots and collecting that data across time.
    - cugraph is looking to include temporal graph support. Are there items from that we'd like to include in NX?
    - graphs with edge/node time interval attribute -> collection of graphs across time. Can hold timestamp as node/edge data attribute. Or can make a new dict level in a dict-of-dict-....of-dict structure. Or can store a list/dict of Graphs at each time. What is the use-case? That could determine if this is practical for a Python based tool like NetworkX. 
    - could also be a continuous time ODE system for node/edge attributes changing in time.
    - we figure most use cases are filtering the temporal graph nodes/edges to those that are active at a specific time.
    - One [Nx-discuss email](https://groups.google.com/g/networkx-discuss/c/w8F3i1SHmjc) asked about finding shortest path using temporal graph where wait time should be added if you want to use an edge that doesn't exist at the time of arrival to that edge. This might be possible with an edge weight function that keeps track of shortest path length found so far and adjusts the edge weight for a soon-to-be existing edge based on how long we have to wait. 
    - Comment by Derek:  Per the existence of https://www.raphtory.com/ (as @eriknw pointed out), and the specialized nature of temporal graphs in general (e.g. time-evolving analytics) vs. the typical static graph analysis that NX currently covers, I do wonder whether folks think introducing temporal graph support might be a slippery slope towards scope creep? Not even certain that a backend for Raphtory would be necessary given that there seem to already be converters in place: https://www.raphtory.com/user-guide/export/3_networkx/
    - [user=Stéfan] Does NetworkX care about use of their name like that? Immediate question that came up for me: is this an NX team effort? (Clearly not.)
      - See [NumPy Fair Play NEP](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0036-fair-play.html#fair-play-rules)
- [SPECs](https://scientific-python.org/specs/)
    - Are we ready to endorse SPECs: 
        - [6: securing keys](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0006/)
            - Three types of keys we have
                - Pypi
                - Conda-forge
                - domain name
        - [7: pseudorandom handling](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0007/)
          - Should have Ross here to discuss that one
        - [8: securing the release process](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0008/)
          - We already follow these practices
    - "Note that endorsing doesn’t mean we have to implement or follow everything, just that we endorse and recommend this practice for the wider ecosystem. We may chose to not implement something because it doesn’t make sense for us."

### Dispatch Topic
- Thoughts on [Issue #7623](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/7623) to separate graph input validation from algorithms?
- [TODO-Jarrod] Release [nx-parallel](https://github.com/networkx/nx-parallel) v0.3
- [open dispatching PRs:](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3ADispatching)
    - prioritized list from dispatch meeting: #7494 #7499 #7498 #7497 #7496 #7505 #7485 #7528 #7294 #7259.     There are more comments and info in the [dispatch meeting notes](https://hackmd.io/rqs_pWMxSLmICXCpI3w-Ug)
    - Merged [#7585](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7585)! :Tada:
- Rust backend(POC) - https://github.com/thomasjpfan/rustworkx-backend
    - [SPEC 2 on Dispatching](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0002/) updated!! Thanks Aditi!!

## Collect Ideas for 4.0
- Should we start naming new modules with a leading underscore? This would simplify tab-completion by hiding modules.
- Restructure namespace: Review public interface: For v4.0 we should be looking at the import structure?  Some subpackages are not imported to the main namespace. We have decided that based on history of how they were first committed. Is there a good way to decide which should require an extra referal: `network.community.modularity` instead of `networkx.modularity`?
    - nx.dag might be a place to see how much churn  would entail.
  - First decision: what do we *want* the interface to be?
  - Module/pkg `__dir__` provides a nice way to modify discoverability of modules/packages **without** breaking existing code
  - NX-guide idea: model/visualize the package as a DAG (thanks Matt!)
- Generators revamp as per NXEP 3
  * [NXEP 3] Graph Builders and Generators (https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/doc/developer/nxeps/nxep-0003.rst)
    * [June 14] How to handle the docs for two functions nx.path_graph and nx.path_graph_generator
    * [June 14] Do we have a decorator create two functions in the main namespace? Or just hardcode the two functions in the module? Ideas on cutting down duplication of code/effort?
    * We should have a conversation about how dispatching should interact with these graph builders.
    * Rewritten Text merged! :tada: in [#6648](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/6648)
    * Maybe make private functions that are generators. Could start now. Could be used to see how much impact it has on speed, memory use, etc. We can test it out privately and see what are the advantages. 
    * Motivation to make these changes for random graphs: [#5672](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5672) requests `create_using` arg for random graph generators so that subclass of Graph can be built by the generator
- Temporal Graphs
- Hyper Graphs
- Universal binary graph storage
    - Let's look at Arrow
    - Also look at binsparse
    - [Graphtool's binary format](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/gt_format.html)

### Possible (mentored) Projects
 
- To make contributions of new centrality algorithms more compelling, it would be helpful to have a large set of tests showing what are the expected values and how it is different from other measures of centrality. [add this discussion result to the contributors FAQ] (@rossbar)
- For centrality, a mentored project could test and document the various centrality measures and their differences on a suite of graphs. [add to list in the docs!]
- Visualization features/improvements
  * Marker intersection PR for drawing [#4601](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4601)

## NXEP Topics
  * We should create an NXEP describing dispatching.
  * Could we add the NXEP status to the documentation page with the list of NXEPs and their titles?  Maybe like: `NXEP 0 - Accepted - Purpose and process`. This might require changes to sphinx/autodoc. Any easy way to annotate within `index.rst` and still allow the autodoc links to be formed? 
  * According to NXEP 0 we should be converting NXEPs that are implemented to the status: Final...  not Accepted. Perhaps a PR to do that for 0, 1, 2 and 4 is in order. 
  * NXEP 4: TODO [name=rossbar] - propose acceptance on mailing list

## Long-term tracking items

  - let's collect a list(s) of network analysis problems that are really good, and that dispatch makes that possible to solve.
      - pypi connections of projects by requirements
      - tools to load datasets from a given url

- Landing Page Translation to multiple written languages. See [networkx-website 21](https://github.com/networkx/website/issues/21) 

- let's try to get a focused sprint for working on NetworkX in the next 4-12 months

- Org-level accounts on PyPi - we have applied, waiting to hear back

  * Submitted April 25, 2023, got confirmation. waiting for authorization. The ["about" item on the pypi organization page](https://docs.pypi.org/organization-accounts/) says the program is in "closed beta" at the moment.
  
- Revisiting our pytest `slow` mark: (from near the bottom of this document) 
  * The `slow` tests are run w/ each push/PR in the coverage job; however, it's not necessarily true that the slow tests improve coverage!
  * Could save a lot of CI time by having a separate category (e.g. `pytest.mark.comprehensive`?) that is for tests that are slow but *don't* affect coverage. These could be run less frequently (scheduled job?) and potentially save several minutes for each push
    - General consensus: seems like a good idea
- Other CI-saving ideas
    - All tests should depend on the lint action, so all the other tests fail fast.(Maybe only do this just before a sprint where many tasks could  jam up the CI.)

- nx pkg namesquatting on Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/nx/#description
  * TODO: https://github.com/pypi/support/issues - PEP 541
  * March 27, 2024: dschult emailed team@nx.pub to ask if they are willing to remove the package name from pypi, or transfer it to us.
  * Response: `Alex Doe <alexdoesh@gmail.com>
  * `Just in case, it’s not a name squatting or smth similar, I still work on a project (it’s a strict/static python aot compiler to webassembly, no interpreter) and hope to release it publicly this year. In case of inability to do so, I will notify you. Thank you and have a great day.`
  * So I think we should wait till 2025 and then contact again.

SPECS
-----
  - [SPEC 7: random seeding](https://github.com/scientific-python/specs/pull/180#issuecomment-1570678859)
    - We have NXEP-4 to discuss this https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/developer/nxeps/nxep-0004.html
    - Ross will review and coauthor SPEC 7
  
  - https://scientific-python.org/specs/
      - nx endorsed 0, 1, and 4
      - what about the [Accessibility SPEC 3?]( https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0003/) We support the accessibility goals and ideas, but most changes would need to be put in sphinx themes and other upstream tools. How do we support that and what would endorsing the SPEC mean for this topic?

- Do we have any info about what functions are most used/popular?
  * not from the survey - request for next iteration!
  * Guen (@guenp) is working with Matt (@mdhaber) on telemetry
  * We could look at networkx itself to see how often individual functions are called in the codebase itself
    * Jim Pivarski (@jpivarski) is working on a tool that would help with this at the May 2023 developer summit. Results?

- TODO from [igraph meeting](https://igraph.org/workshop.html) (June 21-22)
  - Group will be formed, e.g. "network science software sustainability group"
     * Convince other organizations/conferences to contribute to OSS Network software
  - Met graphtool dev, igraph devs, gephi
    * It'd be nice to have a list of github handles for folks from different communities
      - e.g. the gephi folks are GEXF experts, it'd be great to know who to ping!
  - Discussions on file format standarization for graph data (i.e. json-like)
  - Leiden is awesome
  - Basic dispatching discussion: topical discussion, folks are aware
  - More cross-community coordination to come!

- Teams Changes:
  - What else needs to be done with Teams changes? 
  Anybody else to add? Changes to "owners"?
    * 3 proposed teams [not agreed upon yet]:
      - maintainers (with commit rights)
      - triage (with triage rights)
      - emeritus (no active rights)
    * vs keep current teams and governance documents and just update the role for core developer from triage to write  [decided to switch to write access] Updated the core team too and removed emeritus owners.

- Adopt `pyproject.toml`?
  - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/6774 (merged)
  - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/6780 (merged)
  - https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz/pull/471

- Best Practices for NX?
  - helpful to have a place for best-practices like nbunch, view vs dict, subgraph vs subgraph.copy()
  * nx-guides would be a good place for this!

- Keyword-only and maybe position-only input. Candidate subpackage to start changing code to keyword-only is the nx_pylab. (see [SLEP009](https://scikit-learn-enhancement-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/slep009/proposal.html) for how sklearn did this)

- We should try to automate the release process as much as possible so that we could remove a human from the release process. conda-forge has a very automated release system. Would a SPEC covering automated releases be reasonable?
    - Not clear what the advanatges of automating the release process would be. The process is [documented](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/doc/developer/release.rst) What would make this better?
    - Why would automating things further not cause problems?
    - That's agree to make sure a PR's title is helpful and descriptive before merging it.

- VIZ keywords arrows, arrowstyle, connectionstyle. Can we improve this interface? [#5694](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5694) and a link to the [current interface](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/2c904d18dc79df3acd64495ef64c6ff4674992a0/networkx/drawing/nx_pylab.py#L537)
    - Now raise UserWarnings when users request features that are not available for the underlying edge-viz object (e.g. LineCollection)
    - Is there a better, more wholistic solution?
    - Need to indicate:
      o FancyArrowPatch or LineCollection
      o The arrowstyle (head or not or both, etc)
      o The connectionstyle (arc bendable etc)
    - Maybe changing the name of `arrows` to `fancyedges` would help
    - New logic could be:  If non-default value for either arrowstyle or connectionstyle then switch to FancyArrowPatch.

- Property-based testing
  * Check out `hypothesis` for setting up property-based testing
  * Developing good property-based tests:
    - Reference "naive" (but correct) implementation
    - Generate random graphs, evaluate them for the property you want
    - Pump these through the naive implementation and collect interesting cases for test suite

- Temporal networks: how to think about these
  * seems to be a lot of interest from different communities, but no standard approach yet...
  * Having a use-case to drive the design of a data structure would be good
  
- nx-guides
  * We need a contributor guide :book: [name=Mridul]
  * Dependency management for tutorials - how to strike a balance between tools people use and maintainability

- New contributors
  * So many good students/contributions - how do we keep the ball rolling (even if we can only accept 1 or a subset of them for this round)
    - Add something to contributor guide about where to look for good issues (e.g. add missing docstring examples)
    - Link to [first issue tag](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/labels/Good%20First%20Issue) on github?

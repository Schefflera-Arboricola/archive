  * NX + scikit-learn are confirmed for sprints! :tada: 

## Topics

- [name=MridulS] 2.8.5? 
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5796 - There is a performance regression after adding cacheing to graph properties, should we revert this? 
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5792 - Another pydot bug :/
    - We have merged a bunch of changes into main which were meant for 3.0. Backports - https://github.com/MridulS/networkx/tree/backports_2.8.5

- [name=rossbar,MridulS] Intermittent CI issues: macOS+pygraphviz
  * Likely related to a new macOS 11.6 image, see e.g. https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/5791
  * For now: ignore failing `test-extra` and `test-prelease` jobs on macos

- Should we keep a 2.8 available?
  * E.g. some libraries that can't immediately update
  * For example, still releasing 1.X series after 2.0 came out (for a few months)
  * Is sparse arrays the only thing that requires the scipy 1.8
  * Strong support for backporting
  * Discuss further next week

- keywords arrows, arrowstyle, connectionstyle. Can we improve this interface? [#5694](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5694) and a link to the [current interface](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/2c904d18dc79df3acd64495ef64c6ff4674992a0/networkx/drawing/nx_pylab.py#L537)
    - Need to indicate:
      o FancyArrowPatch or LineCollection
      o The arrowstyle (head or not or both, etc)
      o The connectionstyle (arc bendable etc)
    - Maybe changing the name of `arrows` to `fancyedges` would help
    - New logic could be:  If non-default value for either arrowstyle or connectionstyle then switch to FancyArrowPatch.
    - milestone this for v3.0

- cached_property vs property: The switch to cached_property seems to have slowed a couple of operations such as `copy`.  What operations get slow? Is it due to the `hasattr` check in ``__init__`` or the cached_property decorator?
  * Currently has the 2.8.5 milestone - let's try to chase down

- LaTeX interface. How much do we test the LaTeX side on CI? Should we include test files that would only be run locally where LaTeX is installed?
   - let's test our end and watch in future for reports of problems.
   - we could think of writing this to work with TikZ rather than adigraph
   - we could add checkson the images generated to the release process for any release candidates

- Currently `complete_graph`, `cycle_graph` and a few others don't return what they say they return if the incoming nodes contain duplicates. It is easy to fix this and it must be done if we switch to not using `nodes_or_number` on these functions. But it changes the return values. Do we just correct this oversight in v3.0? Or do we deprecate and correct it in v3.2.  Do we need to protect users who are using duplicates? They probably didn't intend to include duplicates and are currently getting surprising results?
  * E.g. `complete_graph("abcb")` gives a self-edge b->b. For a path, changing the order gives different output
  * Duplicates in lists of nodes currently silently give a "wrong" answer - i.e. cycles are not simple
  * Is this a feature or a bug?
    - A: Bug - not *technically* correct

- For v3.0 should we be looking at the import structure?  Some subpackages are not imported to the main namespace. We have decided that based on history of how they were first committed. Is there a good way to decide which should require an extra referal: `network.community.modularity` instead of `networkx.modularity`?
  - First decision: what do we *want* the interface to be?
  - Module/pkg `__dir__` provides a nice way to modify discoverability of modules/packages **without** breaking existing code
  - NX-guide idea: model/visualize the package as a DAG (thanks Matt!)

## Long-term tracking items

- Property-based testing
  * Check out `hypothesis` for setting up property-based testing
  * Developing good property-based tests:
    - Reference "naive" (but correct) implementation
    - Generate random graphs, evaluate them for the property you want
    - Pump these through the naive implementation and collect interesting cases for test suite

- Looking at the Roadmap - what do we want on there?
  * Some ideas:
    - GraphBLAS in the performance section
    - Temporal networks, hypergraphs, other new graph types?
    - Make testing more comprehensive -- mixed node types, hashable nodes, etc. (hypothesis?)
    - Benchmarking suites to at least run locally some timing.

- Temporal networks: how to think about these
  * seems to be a lot of interest from different communities, but no standard approach yet...
  * Having a use-case to drive the design of a data structure would be good
  
- Stop building/shipping pdf version of documentation?
  * This is being considered by both scipy and numpy and seems to have garnered mostly positive feedback
    - related scipy issue: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/15635
  * revisit after 2.8 release
  * Keep up-to-date with feedback from other projects that are considering this

- nx-guides
  * We need a contributor guide :book: [name=Mridul]
  * Dependency management for tutorials - how to strike a balance between tools people use and maintainability

- New contributors
  * So many good students/contributions - how do we keep the ball rolling (even if we can only accept 1 or a subset of them for this round)
    - Add something to contributor guide about where to look for good issues (e.g. add missing docstring examples)
    - Link to [first issue tag](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/labels/Good%20First%20Issue) on github?
    
- Revisiting our pytest `slow` mark:
  * The `slow` tests are run w/ each push/PR in the coverage job; however, it's not necessarily true that the slow tests improve coverage!
  * Could save a lot of CI time by having a separate category (e.g. `pytest.mark.comprehensive`?) that is for tests that are slow but *don't* affect coverage. These could be run less frequently (scheduled job?) and potentially save several minutes for each push
    - General consensus: seems like a good idea
    - (Jarrod) maybe worth waiting until after the code removal sprint?

- Other CI-saving ideas
    - All tests should depend on the lint action, so all the other tests fail fast.
    - Another one: configure CI to stop running tests from a previous commit when a new commit is pushed up (I think scipy does this, so can copy their config)

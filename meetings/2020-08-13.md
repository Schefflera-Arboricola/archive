# NetworkX Developer Discussions:  August 13th, 2020

In attendance: Ross, Jarrod, Dan, Kelly, Aric, Mridul, Eric, Stefan

## Highest priority:

 - Proposed new release schedule:
   * 2.5 ASAP
   * 2.6 (new) late fall, additional time to prep for 3.0, fleshing out API changes
     - A more relaxed schedule here helps with pygraphviz release as well
   * 3.0 - still February

 - Roadmap
   * See **Roadmap discussions** below and [this supporting doc](https://github.com/networkx/archive/blob/master/meetings/2020-08-13_roadmap_discussion.md), which covers additional topics and goes into greater detail.

## Roadmap discussions
   - what items would you like to see addressed/changed in v3.0?
   - One goal is to make it easier to implement things in the future. What challenges are there? 
1. e.g. New additions (incorporating visualization) needs coverage from developers
  [Camille?]
  
2. scipy sparse graph + (consider) PyData/Sparse [Stéfan and/or Søren]
   - **Action item:** NXEP (informational at least) about sparse representations
     * How/where used in NX
     * Other sparse libraries
       * `scipy.sparse`
       * `csgraph`
         - Depends on scipy.sparse.csr_matrix
       * `pydata.sparse`
         - supports > 2 dimensions
       * `convert_matrix.py` refactor: instead of `to/from` functions, have the formats potentially be a kwarg option

3. Many algorithms depend on node/edge properties - how are these consumed? with a "weight" function as in shortest_path? [Dan]
  - **Action:** Stick this inside 3.0?
      - Desired semantics when weight key is missing from Graph: user-configurable to raise error (default) or replace with default value (user-specified as a function), weight

4. dispatching mechanism for nx data structures. That is, build an API so that data structures supporting that API could be used for our algorithms by dispatching calls to those data structures.
  [S: Wait to see if Greg Lee is funded under CZI for developing dispatching for skimage?  If not urgent, we can re-use his work.]
  
5. Is the array-form a property of the graph object or a separate object?
  - A keyword flag to handle conversion from graph objects to necessary array form for accelerated calculation
  - `G = (V, E) <=> (F, A)`  (graph is a two-tuple of (V, E), as well as a two-tuple of (F, A))
      - (EM): I suspect two different object representations might be more sane. There's also tricky semantics converting (V) to (F).
 
6. NX turbo (historical discussion)
  - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/1076
  - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/1076#issuecomment-37876456
  - https://gitter.im/networkx/GSoC_2015?at=54f4253e0cfa7291277d0f71
  - maybe we could use a decorator?
  - tied into how we generator graphs
  - https://github.com/UDST/pandana
 
7. NumPy + SciPy as dependencies, and subsequent speed improvements (needs decision from group, thereafter Ross?)
  * This will at least be partially covered in the informational NXEP

## Topics

 - Use tidelift as a funding source for outreachy/outreach activities? NumPy/SciPy are part of it (@Ross can you confirm this?). Apparently networkx could get around 600-700$/month https://tidelift.com/lifter/search/conda/networkx, https://tidelift.com/lifter/search/pypi/networkx


**Note:** This week's meeting was dedicated to roadmap discussions. The items below the break were not addressed.

## Followup from last week

 - Sprint followup
   * Hackmd from sprint 1: https://hackmd.io/s7IdLCGOQByr-kS0HvxtPg
   * Related: PyData global sprint? Developer vs. new contributor sprints?

 - Label maintenance
   * Maintenance seems too generic (documentation? enhancement?)
   * Are "enhancement" and "new feature" close enough to be one tag?
     - Currently [27 open issues/PRs](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/labels). Replace with "enhancement" and delete the label?
   * Can "needs review" be replaced by the standard workflow for pull requests?
     - Currently 12 issues/PRs with this label. Review these, assign to reviewers, & delete the label?

   * **TODO** - work on moving from appveyor to github actions for windows
     - Add dependency installation (numpy/scipy/pygraphviz) to windows

## Topics

1. Move `pre-commit` formatting stuff to a GitHub action? https://github.com/pre-commit/action
   - No more black/flake8/pre-commit dependencies for users, formatting changes all applied via CI

2. Use tidelift as a funding source for outreachy/outreach activities? NumPy/SciPy are part of it (@Ross can you confirm this?). Apparently networkx could get around 600-700$/month https://tidelift.com/lifter/search/conda/networkx, https://tidelift.com/lifter/search/pypi/networkx

## Discussion

**Note: left this here from previous week as it seemed like a good thing to keep discussing. Please modify (or move to a future meeting agenda) as is fit**
 - For a future meeting: discuss future summer of code (get Mridul's perspective)
 - Action item: contact other graph libraries about starting a network science forum
   * snap (stanford) Jure Leskovec at jure@cs.stanford.edu
   * SIAM network science conference, http://lists.siam.org/mailman/listinfo/siam-ns
   * Igraph, Gábor Csárdi https://igraph.discourse.group/ (they have CZI funding starting September 1 https://igraph.org)
   * graphtool, Tiago Peixoto https://graph-tool.skewed.de/mailing
   * cytoscape https://cytoscape.org/community.html
   * gephi? (not a lib really)
   * JUNG?
   * please add to the list...

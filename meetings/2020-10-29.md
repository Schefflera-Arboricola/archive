## Discussion

- Goals for 2.6
  * Deprecation candidates
    * `nx_shp`
    * Search for `_iter`
    * Union, compose, Euler path - testing is inadequate
    * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4179

## Notes from last week (no discussion)
- Conferences (tl;dr - none are open for submissions yet)
  * SIAM network science workshop (typically in July)
    - No website for NS21 yet (AFAICT)
    - Last year's submission deadline was 02/20/2020
  * SciPy conferences (main one also in July)
    - Submission deadline likely to be in mid Feb.
  * IC2S2 (Computational social science)
    - [It appears](https://2019.ic2s2.org/ic2s2-2021/) they're still soliciting proposals for *hosting* the next conference.
    
- Tracking issue about missing algorithms from the package
  * Ping the mailing list to have users help us fill this out

- Topic for Kelly:
  - Make an effort to connect with D-wave's algorithms... at least make the API similar-or same.

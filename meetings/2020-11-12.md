In attendance: Stefan, Ross, Dan, Jarrod, Mridul

## Welcome and news

- Update on Pydata sprint (Mridul)
  * Sunday 11/15/20: 12 - 4PM PST
  * Format: zoom + gathertown
  * TODO: Send links to other co-developers, Jon Crall, James Tremble, other devs currently active...
- Structured labelled arrays PR (Eric)
- NumFOCUS Application Review status (Ross)
  * Notified on 11/11 that NumFOCUS is pushing back their decision date from 11/15 -> 12/7 due to high volume of applications.
- Geospatial update (Jarrod)
  * Jarrod met with Nicolas Cadieux
  * Jarrod also met with Levy Wolf 
    - Will give examples for GeoPandas, pysal, maybe osmnx
    - Can @ him for review of geospatial examples
    - His opinion: remove nx_shp (after we have geospatial gallery examples)
- NX Release schedule (Jarrod)
  * Proposal: Push 3.0 back and add a 2.7
  * Goals: geospatial, sparse stuff
  * Motivation for 2.6: (explicit) Python 3.9 support (already works)
  * Proposed plan:
    - 2.6 Dec/Jan (3.9 support)
      * Keep Python 3.6 if release soon
    - 2.7 May
    - 3.0 May/June

## Topics

 - Travis-CI
   * See [#4320](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4320) - move linux testing to github-actions
   * Still need to move doc deployment.

## Discussion

- Goals for 2.6
  * Deprecation candidates
    * `nx_shp`
    * Search for `_iter`
    * Union, compose, Euler path - testing is inadequate
    * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4179

## Notes from last week (no discussion)

- Tracking issue about missing algorithms from the package
  * Ping the mailing list to have users help us fill this out

- Topic for Kelly:
  - Make an effort to connect with D-wave's algorithms... at least make the API similar-or same.

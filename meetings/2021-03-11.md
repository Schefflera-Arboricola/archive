**In attendance:** Ross, Dan, Jarrod, Mridul, Kelly, Stefan

## Welcome and news

- GraphXD: https://bids.berkeley.edu/events/graphxd-2021

## Topics

- GSoC
  * NumFocus has been accepted - next steps for NX?
  * Process:
    - We solicit & evaluate proposals from intersted students
      * Projects must be individual
    - Then we submit to NumFocus the min and max number of GSoC students we'd like to mentor
      * We currently have 3 mentors (Dan, Mridul, Ross)
      * **Action Item**: To become an *official* mentor, fill out the form: https://forms.gle/ewnGzzQUqp5t9URG6

- Add `isort` to linting checks?
  * Noticed a lot of PRs include automatic re-organizing of imports based on alphabetical order.
  * Decision: ask users *not* to include auto-reformatted imports in PRs
  
- Import style in modules
  * Avoid `import *` in modules (`__init__.py` is fine)
  * Systematically check the code base for this patter (Kelly)
  * Also absolute vs. relative imports? Another project

- Changing default branch name
  * Check-in: everything seems to be up & running - any problems to report?
  * Seems all green
  
- CZI Grant proposal
  * Roles: community manager + new features
    - New features: interop with other graph libraries
  * Biomedical use-cases
    - cytoscape? Streaming graph algorithms
  * Another grant proposal: scipy.sparse

- [ ] Testing for Union, compose, Euler path

## PRs that need an opinion

- https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4594
  Do we always want to build docs even when they're not modified?  Maybe, to see the gallery, e.g.
  But can at least avoid running tests in response to docs-only changes.

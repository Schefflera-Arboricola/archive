### Meeting Notes:
The most recent meeting notes with the long list of topics that we used to always keep in the notes/agenda is [2025-04-11.md](https://github.com/networkx/archive/blob/main/meetings/2025-04-11.md)
We intend to keep the meeting notes much shorter by shifting what has been discussed into issues or discussions through github. We'll see how that works.

**In attendance**: Shammeer, Dan, Rick, Erik, Alejandro, Ross, Matt

### Action Items

- Would we like to use the [NumFOCUS Code of Conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct)? We don't have to, but they will provide resources for helping with any events that arise.
    - [The current NetworkX Code of Conduct](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst)
    - most comments were supportive of using the numfocus version. 
    - would like to hear from Mridul about his impression and recommendation
- Is nx-guides a good place to put notebooks that demonstrate nx-cugraph as a way to show how to use backends.
    - testing of the guide might require GPU-time. It sounds like NVIDIA might be able to provide resources to run those tests on their hardware.
    - node assortativity nx-guide came up in a search on that topic.
-  Can we make the guides show up better on the tabs at the top of the documentation?
-  connect gallery and guides
-  connected dominating sets -- let's explore using [minimum spanning tree iterators](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.tree.mst.SpanningTreeIterator.html) to build iterators of connected dominating sets. 
-  who is blocking analytics? caltech seems to be. It was in the list of blocking services urls to block that Matt was using.

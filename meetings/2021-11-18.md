## Topics

- From last week: New algorithms implementations: What should go in?
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/5164
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/4808
    - How do other projects deal with this?
        - scikit-learn https://scikit-learn.org/stable/faq.html#why-are-you-so-selective-on-what-algorithms-you-include-in-scikit-learn, https://scikit-learn.org/stable/faq.html#what-are-the-inclusion-criteria-for-new-algorithms
    - Could this be something of a wider interest? like a post on scientific-python discourse?

- GitHub "Sponsor this project" enabled
  * Contacted NumFOCUS - they said our finances should show up in a new spreadsheet in the shared google drive that they set up for NetworkX by EOW.
  * Also tidelift - following up with them as well
  * Open-collective portal should be available in the future
  
- pyparsing-CI shenanigans update
  * The 3.0.X series of `pyparsing` broke not only `pydot` (which borked our pydot tests) but also the built-in Python `packaging` module.
  * `packaging` solved this by pinning `pyparsing` to <3, which caused problems with the temporary fix that I had up which pinned to == 3.0.
  * Long story short: reverted the change to get things working again, but this is still fragile - if `packaging` removes the pin before `pydot` introduces a fix, we might see the `pydot` test failures crop up again... we can cross that bridge when we come to it though.
  * Problems are back!
    - Should we pin again? `skipif`/remove pydot tests? Other ideas?
    - rossbar reported to `pyparsing` itself, but haven't looked at exactly what's causing the problem yet (since it lives in pydot).

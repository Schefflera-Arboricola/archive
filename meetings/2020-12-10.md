    - See [NXEP3](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4395)
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4179
  * Pagerank (also hits) - other algorithms that have multiple (numpy/scipy/python) implementations
    - See [tracking issue](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4371)
  * type dispatch (NXEP? draft form)

- numfocus accepted our application so we should be able to get money into that account to use for activities :tada: 
  * Next step: Ross, Jarrod, Mridul, Kelly & Dan read and sign fiscal sponsorship agreement (check email)

- To follow up: GSoC & Outreachy
    - GSoC is now ~6weeks - better map to projects
    - Apps open ~Jan-ish
    - NSF network science infrastructure program? https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2021/nsf21514/nsf21514.htm?WT.mc_id=USNSF_25&WT.mc_ev=click
    - Graphviz/networkx grant focus

- Enable Github discussions? https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/#discussions

## Topics

- Lazy imports: Stefan has worked up in scikit-image: https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/5101
- Java Infovis Toolkit - dead project?
  * Anyone familiar with the format, whether it's still actively used?
  * xref: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4428
- NetworkX subclass examples in gallery
  * Do we encourage users to subclass? Are there alternatives to subclassing?
  * Potentially move these examples?

- [x] Get improved error message for slicing Node/EdgeViews (see NXEP2) (Mridul)
- [x] Deprecate `pyyaml`, `gpickle` (Jarrod)


## Discussion

- Goals for 2.6
  * Deprecation candidates
    * [x] `nx_shp`
    * [x] Search for `_iter`
    * Union, compose, Euler path - testing is inadequate

## Notes from last week (no discussion)

- Tracking issue about missing algorithms from the package
  * Ping the mailing list to have users help us fill this out

- Topic for Kelly:
  - Make an effort to connect with D-wave's algorithms... at least make the API similar-or same.

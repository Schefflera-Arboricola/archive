## Topics

- Tidelift (wsg Sebastian Berg)
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/security/policy
 
- Keyword-only arguments: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5063

- NX2.7 (12/31/21) and 3.0 (2/28/22)
    - drop Python 3.7
      * Would include cleanups like:
        - math.permutations
        - printing differences between 3.7/3.8?
        - Review things like this: replace home-grown features with Python built-ins where possible

## Discussion

 - Tidelift thoughts, from Sebastian
   * NumPy has been w/ tidelift for 2 years
   * Have gotten security 3 inquiries/reports, but not many. 1 was acted on (and had a bit of discussion) 1 was a segfault in pickle and numpy responded that it was not a security issue. The last was a C checker which numpy looked at and reported that they had checked it and found no security issues.
   * Need a short summary for releases (distilled release notes, currently done by Ralf for NumPy)
   * NumPy started at ~$500, but it's higher now
   * Initially hesitant because of liability/advertisement statements, but that hasn't yet materialized into anything
     - Dan: in terms of advertisement: supposed to put a statement in your security policy that you use tidelift
   * NumPy also does it through NumFOCUS - NumFOCUS has a custom contract where numfocus is the responsible for the liability, not the project
     - Includes a clause that says NumPy can leave at any time
   * Sebastian's experience with security issues
     - Bug reported, Sebastian reviewed, none were serious, Sebastian said "please follow up if interested" and that was the end of it
   
   ## Takeaways
    - The burden of setting a [security policy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/security/policy) is very minimal.
    - Have never had an issue where NumPy got stuck on anything security related
    - Minimal follow-up/feedback from Tidefilt

   ## Action items
   - [x] Dan will reply-all to the Numfocus email re: tidelift

 - Keyword-only arguments
   * Ideas: Have a decorator that catches kwarg-only errors and re-emits them as warnings
   * Check if other projects in the ecosystem have tried this
   * Example of something that would be "fixed" by kwarg only: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4845
   * Some groups of functions, e.g. shortest path, that have similar signatures where it would make sense that all of the functions have the kwarg-only break
   * One idea: think about adopting for *new* functionality - avoids the backwards-compatibility/noisiness problem

   ## Action items
   - [ ] Ross will update the discussion in #5063 with a summary of the above. Please feel free to add any other thoughts/comments!

# NetworkX Developer Discussions: April 1st, 2022

Previous meeting notes available [here](https://github.com/networkx/archive/tree/main/meetings). Please feel free to add topics for discussion and news items below.

**In attendance:** Ross, Kelly, Jarrod, Dan, Dimitris, Erik, Mridul, Matt

## Welcome and news

## Important dates/deadlines

- NX 2.8 (4/4/22)
  * rc1 on monday
- NX 3.0 (5/31/22)

## News

 - NetworkX tutorial selected for scipy 2022! :tada: 

## Topics

- Public keys on GitHub
    - Explicitly mention which key is used to sign the releases, https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/2850

- [name=Dan] Average Neighbor Degree [#5404]( https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/5404) currently has definitions that don't make sense for an average (uses the sum of one population divided by the number of objects in a different population). What is the deprecation path for changes that fix this?  #5404 fixes the problem, so the output values will change. Can we just change it without any deprecations? 
  * 5404 is in :tada: 
- Similarly [#5394](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/5394) corrects an error in min_weight_matching that is used by TSP. Maybe both should go in before 2.8?
  * Needs another pair of :eyes: 

- [name=Mridul?] Improve documentation for our base classes.
  - [ ] https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4765
  - [ ] https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4523
  - [ ] https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4433
  - [ ] https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/3239
and maybe
  - [ ] https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4157
  - [ ] https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4895
  - [ ] https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/5374

- [name=Ross] Migration guide
  - [ ] https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/doc/release/migration_guide_from_2.x_to_3.0.rst
It would be good to at least hightlight a few things now. In particular, discussing sparse array stuff.
  - [ ] more deprecation opportunities
  - [ ] clean up/improve our tests

- Outreachy
  * Thanks Mridul for the awesome setup!
    - Lot's of interactions with new contributors, I think the "scaffolding" that has been set up to guide them through setup is great (and should probably be used in more projects)

- Adding a `G.describe` method - more positive feedback on this.
  * Aim for 2.8 or push? Might make sense to try for 2.8 since we deprecated `info` - could update the deprecation message with something like "`info` is deprecated, use `print(G)` for a quick summary or `G.describe()` for more info"
  * General feeling: let's wait until there's a concrete proposal; not for 2.8

- [name=Ross] Activity in `scipy.sparse.csgraph` spectral embedding:
  * https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/15391
  * Related mailing list post: https://mail.python.org/archives/list/scipy-dev@python.org/thread/7JKMG6XSDGZRR2M5AVSHCA6KSLHVGOU7/

## Long-term tracking items

- Temporal networks: how to think about these
  * seems to be a lot of interest from different communities, but no standard approach yet...
  * Having a use-case to drive the design of a data structure would be good
  
- Stop building/shipping pdf version of documentation?
  * This is being considered by both scipy and numpy and seems to have garnered mostly positive feedback
    - related scipy issue: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/15635
  * revisit after 2.8 release
  * Keep up-to-date with feedback from other projects that are considering this


## Discussion

### Action Items
- [Issue 7995: CI intermittent failures](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/7995) Maybe due to pytest-xdist? Has happened twice this week. Restarting test lets it pass.
-`Draw` and `display`:
    - proposal: we can put forward a new function display to make two separate ways of showing networks. To get there, let's each look at it and comment on github about what we find. If enough are ready to go with that, we'll go for that route.
- astars -- we have so many from this class. 
    - maybe have them create a separate package for astar variants. Once that is fleshed out and organized then we could consider implementing in networkx. 
    - What about implementing the various variants as backends... or API-only backend.
- dispatching of classes. Lets look at the [PR 7760](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7760) and whether this is something we want to do.

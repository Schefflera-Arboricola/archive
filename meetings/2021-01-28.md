# NetworkX Developer Discussions: Â January 28th, 2021

In attendance: Dan, Jarrod, Mridul, Ross, Stefan

**NOTE:** if we add the pytest-randomly scheduled workflow, the following badge should show the current status ->
![pytest-randomly status](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/workflows/.github/workflows/pytest-randomly.yml/badge.svg)

## Welcome and news

- NumFOCUS fiscal sponsorship agreement
  * Time to respond!
  * **Action item**: Make "private" copy of FSA doc and add comments about wording (Ross will copy + email everyone)
  
## Topics

- Appveyor
  * Has been removed (both config and hooks)
  * Keep an eye on PRs for erroneous red-X's: might need to suggest rebases or just ignore appveyor failures

- pyyaml problems
  * Mridul took care of it - packager seemed not to mind to move to a non-release commit. The below probably isn't relevant anymore.
  * Spate of issues/PRs related to pyyaml over the past 2 weeks:
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4569
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4548
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4541 (this one seemed like a bot?)
  * Deprecation & fix are already in for 2.6
  * Is there anything to be done about 2.5? (doesn't seem worth a patch release, esp. for deprecated functions)
  - **Action item**: mark r/w tutorial as ready for review
  
- Outreach project stub to docs
  * Add a collection of ideas for mentored projects to docs
  * **Action item**: review https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4576
  * Need concrete project ideas for GSoC by 2/19
  
- Notifications for scheduled gh-actions [e.g #4553](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4553)
  * How to notify devs when scheduled workflows fail (e.g. pytst-randomly)
  * Options
    - Add a status badge somewhere (e.g. here - see top of doc)
    - Set up a notification step to send emails to anyone interested
      * Happy to do so if anyone wants notifications for this - LMK (Ross)

- Pygraphviz 1.7
  * Waiting to see if `chocolatey` will [add the latest windows cmake pkg](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-coreteampackages/issues/1609)
  * Ross will ping NX mailing list when rc2 is out
  * At least [1 independent confirmation](https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz/issues/322) that installing from source on Windows now works
  * Minor change to `nx_agraph` tests for tempfile on Windows

- Contributor FAQ
  * A place in the docs to point those who ask "where do I start" (prompted by mailing list question)

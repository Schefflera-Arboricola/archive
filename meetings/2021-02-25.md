## PRs that need an opinion

- https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4594
  Do we always want to build docs even when they're not modified?  Maybe, to see the gallery, e.g.
  But can at least avoid running tests in response to docs-only changes.

## Discussion

 - Network science/Graph theory video playlist

 - **Action item**: Add a "visualization" category to GitHub discussions
   * Add the above bullet: projects we'd like gallery examples for
   * Add a bullet about gotchas/questions related to visualization
     - let's people know we're thinking about visualization
     - Good place to collect ideas for NXEPs/design docs etc.

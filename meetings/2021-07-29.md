## Discussion

 - JOSS: what can NX/OSS projects do to incorporate/give credit to author's work in upstream projects
   * How do subpackages work w/ JOSS
   * ArXiv has a similar notion of [paper indices](https://arxiv.org/help/submit_index)
 - code owners in GH: https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-code-owners
 - Another set of repository rights (e.g. triage) to increase involvement level

 - 2.7 Discussion
   * Dependencies
     - One idea: no dependencies by default, but have main scientific library packages as "defaults"
     - lazy loading!
       * NX has a PR, skimage has more
       * Have something to add to the error message
       * skimage: machinery for lazy-loading is usable, maybe want additional decorators/wrappers
       * Don't forget the SPEC (Dan as author, if not already) - https://github.com/scientific-python/specs/pull/106/files
     - Tentative schedule: end of summer
       * Add support for 3.10 - so probably early October

   - 2015: Mridul + [Himanshu](https://github.com/OrkoHunter)
 - Add previously-mentored projects stub to developer docs page


 - Graph API in std lib discussions
   * What was the history here?
     - Lost steam after not-super-enthusiastic response from two core Python devs
   * ABC proposal for Graphs: https://www.linux.it/~della/GraphABC/

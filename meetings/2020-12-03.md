# NetworkX Developer Discussions:  December 3rd, 2020

In attendance: Jarrod, Mridul, Dan, Ross, Stefan

## Welcome and news

- Structured labelled arrays PR (Eric)
    - NXEP (rethink edge / node attributes) 
- NX Release schedule (Jarrod)
  * Get geospatial in (examples)
  * Get as many deprecations in as possible
  * Big API changes: `create_using`
    - See [NXEP3](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4395)
  * Pagerank (also hits) - other algorithms that have multiple (numpy/scipy/python) implementations
    - See [tracking issue](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4371)
  * type dispatch (NXEP? draft form)

- numfocus accepted our application so we should be able to get money into that account to use for activities

- To follow up: GSoC & Outreachy
    - GSoC is now ~6weeks - better map to projects
    - Apps open ~Jan-ish
    - NSF network science infrastructure program? https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2021/nsf21514/nsf21514.htm?WT.mc_id=USNSF_25&WT.mc_ev=click
    - Graphviz/networkx grant focus

## Topics

- Lazy imports

  - http://nipy.org/nitime/api/generated/nitime.lazy.html

    ```
    >>> from nitime.lazy import matplotlib_mlab as mlab
    >>> from nx.lazy import scipy_linalg as sla
    ```
    
  - https://snarky.ca/lazy-importing-in-python-3-7/

    Can probably be modified to give:
    
    ```
    from networkx.utils import lazy_import
    sla = lazy_import('scipy.linalg')
    ```

- [x] Deprecate `pyyaml`, `gpickle` (Jarrod)


## Discussion

- Goals for 2.6
  * Deprecation candidates
    * `nx_shp`
    * Search for `_iter`
    * Union, compose, Euler path - testing is inadequate
    * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4179

## Notes from last week (no discussion)

- Tracking issue about missing algorithms from the package
  * Ping the mailing list to have users help us fill this out

- Topic for Kelly:
  - Make an effort to connect with D-wave's algorithms... at least make the API similar-or same.

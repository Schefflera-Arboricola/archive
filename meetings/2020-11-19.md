# NetworkX Developer Discussions:  November 19th, 2020

In attendance: Mridul, Dan, Jarrod, Ross, Stefan

## Welcome and news

- Structured labelled arrays PR (Eric)
- Geospatial update (Jarrod)
  * Ball is rolling - lots of nice examples
- NX Release schedule (Jarrod)
  * Get geospatial in (examples)
  * Get as many deprecations in as possible
  * Big API changes: `create_using`
    - Start of NXEP for `create_using` - good to have backward compatibility
    - adding attribute level manipulation or all nodes or all edges at a time. to_node_dataframe and to edge_dataarray. scale_edge_attr or transform_edge_attr?
    - create a graph subclass that works on a scipy sparse backend
    - other array uses? 
    - utils.misc.py?  flatten?
    - (not API) remove try/import numpy/raise
  * Pagerank (also hits) - other algorithms that have multiple (numpy/scipy/python) implementations

  * To follow up: GSoC & Outreachy
    - GSoC is now ~6weeks - better map to projects
    - Apps open ~Jan-ish

## Topics

- Lazy imports

  - http://nipy.org/nitime/api/generated/nitime.lazy.html

    ```
    >>> from nitime.lazy import matplotlib_mlab as mlab
    >>> from nx.lazy import scipy_linalg as sla
    ```
    
  - https://snarky.ca/lazy-importing-in-python-3-7/

    Can probably be modified to give:
    
    ```
    from networkx.utils import lazy_import
    sla = lazy_import('scipy.linalg')
    ```

## Discussion

- Goals for 2.6
  * Deprecation candidates
    * `nx_shp`
    * Search for `_iter`
    * Union, compose, Euler path - testing is inadequate
    * https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4179

## Notes from last week (no discussion)

- Tracking issue about missing algorithms from the package
  * Ping the mailing list to have users help us fill this out

- Topic for Kelly:
  - Make an effort to connect with D-wave's algorithms... at least make the API similar-or same.

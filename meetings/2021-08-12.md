  * Make sure students have everything they need to hit their desired milestones before
      * Things look good.

- How does Sphinx handle classes? We've got a lot of classes that list methods, but only link __init__ and they show init on the same page. What should the rst file look like? autoclass?
    - https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html#directive-autoclass
    - maybe with :members:

- Should we turn off the "first contributor" approve and run? How is it working for you?
    - review way to make sure things don't get stuck

- Should we give some users permissions to triage or something similar? does it encourage more connection?
    - JM will act on this before next week (hopefully)

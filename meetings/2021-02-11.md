**NOTE:** if we add the pytest-randomly scheduled workflow, the following badge should show the current status ->
![pytest-randomly status](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/workflows/.github/workflows/pytest-randomly.yml/badge.svg)

## Welcome and news

- NumFOCUS fiscal sponsorship agreement
  - Everyone's comments should be collated and have been moved to the official numfocus doc
  - Dan will ping Nicole f/ NumFOCUS to let her know that our first round of comments are ready for review
  
- NetworkX talk at SciPy US(February 16)/PyCon US (February 12)? If they are also pre-recorded talks can we resumbit the video given by Jarrod at PyData? ðŸ™ƒ
  * SUmmary of potential conference plans:
    - Jarrod will take a stab at a NX talk for pycon: heavy on history + applicaitons
    - Mridul + Eric will apply to Pycon/scipy w/ the networkx tutorials
    - No plans for a *talk* at scipy this year (just the tutorial)

## Topics

- Preparing for 2.6 release
  * [x] remaining `nx.utils.misc` are in
  * [x] What to do about `np.matrix`
    - Ross' opinion: push this off, hard to have a "good solution" with scipy.sparse
  * NXEP 3 - edge list generation
    - Another round of updating the document
  * pytest-mpl
    - Jarrod will look at again - shouldn't be a blocker for 2.6 though (nothing user facing)
  * panther++
    - implications for panther API? Confirm this.

- both missing png thumbnail in gallery
  * [Javascript gallery example](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4571)
    - Needs a utility drawing function; where should it go?
    - Emphasize that these plots work in Jupyter
    - Show how to customize the plots based on blocks.io examples
  * [Plotly gallery example](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4507)

- Major documentation revamps? https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs 
  - Ideas for GSoD
    * `networkx-notebooks`
    * Improved tutorial(s)
    * Move documentation from reference guide into the docstrings proper
  - Mridul will investigate some options; Ross will attend NumPy docs meeting on Monday and see what they're saying about the next round of GSoD

Merge/discuss PRs:
Review of test suite and coverage:
- [ ] TSP: Ross will convert comments -> PRs
- [ ] https://codecov.io/gh/networkx/networkx/src/master/networkx/algorithms/isomorphism/temporalisomorphvf2.py
- [ ] Testing for Union, compose, Euler path

## PRs that need an opinion

- https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4594
  Do we always want to build docs even when they're not modified?  Maybe, to see the gallery, e.g.
  But can at least avoid running tests in response to docs-only changes.

## Discussion

 - NX website landing page logo: add a more complex/meaningful graph? Ideas?
 
 - Other gallery examples
 - As many examples to other visualization libraries as possible
    * graphtool?
    * igraph (WIP)

 - **Action item**: Add a "visualization" category to GitHub discussions
   * Add the above bullet: projects we'd like gallery examples for
   * Add a bullet about gotchas/questions related to visualization
     - let's people know we're thinking about visualization
     - Good place to collect ideas for NXEPs/design docs etc.

## Topics

- CZI EOSS Meeting in November...  Are people being asked to give a talk?

- NumFOCUS agreement update signed?
  * Everyone has now signed :tada: 

- Ross & Mridul meet NumFOCUS folks after the meeting today for a project check in. Do we have anything in particular we need to ask them? 

- Hypergraphs: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/5117
  * Had meeting a few weeks ago w/ a Nicholas Landry from UC Boulder who worked with PPNL, the lab that made [HyperNetX](https://github.com/pnnl/HyperNetX)
  * Mridul's model: Multigraph where every layer is an edge set: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/5117#discussioncomment-1432628
  * Are there other ways hypergraphs can be represented with NX's existing data structures?
    - Yes, but a custom data structure might be more efficient.
    - What algorithms/functions are people interested in? Knowing this would help frame the discussion on how hypergraphs can/should be supported
  * Look at sage math's simplex functionality for inspiration?
  * Array representation of hypergraphs? Incidence array

  * History of `Ordered` Graph classes:
    - users were interested in subclassing examples, ordered graphs became the example

  * Perhaps we could make exploration of hypergraph possible with a namespace subpackage that implements it using NetworkX graphs and then tweak/improve areas that address certain desirable queries.  For example, making it possible to project the hypergraph onto a graph where edges indicate shared membership of a hyperedge.

- Related: a Bipartite data structure?
  - Pros:
    * Performance boost for bipartite algorithms
      - e.g. less checking in bipartite functions
  - Cons:
    * What to name the partitions
    * Multipartite - slippery slope

  - Is adding checks when adding nodes/edges via the existing API sufficient? Allows removal of checking from bipartite algorithms, but are there other advantages?
  - Query-side improvements
    * All nodes of a flavor - currently linear time; could be faster if partitions were stored/accessed specially
    
  - An approach for investigating a bipartite class:
    * Start with undirected, non multigraphs
    * Add functionality to prevent adding nodes/edges that break bipartite
    * Begin tweaking internals to see what improvements are possible

- https://discuss.scientific-python.org/ : Discourse forum (Python, Numba, Bokeh, Matplotlib use it) that can replace our mailing list.  Can be used via web or email.
  - Try this out with dev-discuss first, then move google groups nx-discuss to discourse.
     
  - https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/how-do-i-use-discourse-via-email/15279
 

- Using https://github.com/networkx/archive to deposit other documents like the accepted GSoC proposals?
  * Good idea!
  * Be careful about emphasizing `networkx/archive` too much - could be confusing for new users looking at a different repo

- NX-guides: review the new ones
    make suggestions as PRs to the contributor branch. We might eventually consider merging into nx-guides and then making new PRs for improvements in the guide.

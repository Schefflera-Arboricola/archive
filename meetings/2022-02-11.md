- Lazy importing follow-up: do we want to try for 2.7?
    - [name=Dan] to follow up on PR.
        - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4909
        - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5242
          * Move imports that are internal to functions out to the top and lazy import them instead
          * PR #2: lazy load modules like `approximations` and `bipartite` - stay tuned
    - RE: lazy importing subpackges (e.g. `scipy.sparse`) - requires a centralized place to store what has been loaded, causes problems with lazy-loaded delayed import error. General consensus - let's push this off until later as benefit doesn't seem worth the amount of engineering required.
          

- Financials [name=Ross]
  * Give the numfocus typeform a try for submitting invoices as well
    - Invoice approval seems to be sorted: see email on networkx.groups.io. We should always have enough people to handle any submissions/approvals
  * NumFOCUS P&L
    - Still missing Mridul's donated stipend from the NX SciPy 2021 tutorial - inquiry pending


## Topics

- [name=Mridul] Submit applications for Outreachy and GSoC.
    - Started the applications for both.
    - Current mentor roster: Dan, Ross, Mridul
    - We shouldn't aim for more than 1.5x student to mentor ratio.
        - One slot for Outreachy
        - 1-2 for GSoC
        - (this is assuming we get in)
    - Project ideas:
      * New layouts
      * Other graph polynomials

- [name=Jarrod] pygraphviz 1.8 yanked, 1.9 released

- [name=Jarrod] networkx@group.io -> networkx-core@discuss.scientific-python.org
    - https://discuss.scientific-python.org/

- [name=Jarrod] https://libraries.io/pypi/networkx

- [name=Dan] https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5265 would require a new dependency on sympy. Is that a problem?
  * Seems like there are other graph polynomials as well - will those be added?

- Linting - should we add more linters?

- `modularity_max`: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5227. Lots of conversation :) does it need eyes?

- `numpy.matrix` cleanups: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5319
  * Did a few greps to try to find if there were any remaining instances - most appear to be in comments or docstrings

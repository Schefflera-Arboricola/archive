  * Goal: draft PR of `myst-nb`
  
- CI updates
  - [Move doc deployment to CircleCI?](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4134/files)
    * rossbar gave this a try last week - failed miserably
    * Need to set up a dummy org to practice (circleCI seems to have trouble OOB with keys for multiple repos under one org)
  - GH Action for linting
    * New action in place: runs pre-commit and checks for changes black wants to make.

- NumFocus fiscal sponsorship application
  * Need to get hard yesses from our 5 liasons
    - Good to go: Dan, Jarrod, Mridul, Ross - double-check with Kelly
  * Need the roadmap in as well
  * Application due 10/15
    - Rough draft in place

- How to address questions on the issue tracker? Some ideas:
  * If you respond and feel answer is sufficient, close with a polite statement about re-opening with additional information to let the user know they are welcome to follow up
  * If the example is detailed and doesn't get much of a response, perhaps point the user to the mailing list.

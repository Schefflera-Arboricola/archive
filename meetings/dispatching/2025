## January 08, 2025

Attendees: Rick Ratzel, Erik Welch, Anthony Mahanna

### Topics/Notes

- Leiden PRs ready to merge:
    - [PR 7743](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7743): Leiden funcs
    - [PR 7690](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7690): backend-only functions

- Allowing Graph constructors to be dispatchable
    - "can an ArangoDB graph (nx-adb Graph) be created internally when a user creates a nx.Graph()?"


## January 22, 2025

Attendees: Ralph Liu, Rick Ratzel, Aditi Juneja, Erik Welch

### Topics/Notes

- Future meeting: demo plugin hooks using profiler plugin (Erik)

- PRs
    - [PR 7768](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7768): Avoid repeated cache conversion failures
    - [PR 7765](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7765): WIP: add runtime hooks to dispatch system
        - Erik likes current structure; needs documentation
    - [PR 7760](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7760): Dispatch classes such as nx.Graph(backend=...)
        - Will show nx-cugraph and nx-arangodb using this (soon)
    - [PR 7602](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7602): Add _dispatchable._get_convert_kwargs method for more composability
    - (others?)

- Leiden PR - any open concerns?
    - [PR 7743](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7743): Leiden funcs

- Discussion on plugin hooks:
    - Should this topic be elevated to the general discussion?  For example, https://github.com/rapidsai/nx-cugraph/pull/57 could apply generally to NetworkX, so should it be part of NetworkX proper?

- Thoughts on refactoring the dispatching codebase? [issue 7787](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/7787) and [7776](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7776)
    - Any overlap with what we want to see with the dispatching code and [spatch](https://github.com/scientific-python/spatch)?


## February 05, 2025

Attendees: Dan Schult, Mridul Seth, Rick Ratzel, Erik Welch, Ralph Liu

### Topics/Notes

- Mridul: We need user feedback on dispatching
    - Dan: How do we do that? Survey?
    - Mridul: Can NVIDIA help?
    - Erik: Add a link for feedback in the docs
    - Talk to existing cuGraph users
    - Erik has found examples on github (possibly students) where code includes setting the cugraph backend
    - Caltech group that Ross is part of is using community detection - can we get Ross to try dispatching?
        - Ross seems to use more explicit dispatch, he'd be a good candidate for feedback
    - Hypernetx users/devs would be good candidates
        - They've tried this and were successful getting it running, BC perf needed improvement

- Erik: what are the guidelines around using the `_adj` member?
    - Could be dangerous since it's read/write capable
    - Dan/Mridul: okay to use, just be careful
    - non `_` members are read-only views, more expensive

- (no topics)


## February 25, 2025

Attendees: Rick Ratzel, Erik Welch, Ralph Liu, Anthony Mahanna

### Topics/Notes

- First meeting at the new time: Tuesdays at 10:30 Central

- Potential topics (for now or next time):
    - PRs to review
    - Tech debt and how to best work on reducing it
    - Upcoming conferences

- Conferences:
    - Pyconf Hyderabad 2025: https://github.com/Schefflera-Arboricola/pyconf_hyderabad_2025
    - PyData London
        - Erik, Aaron, Mridul planning on a talk
    - SciPy
        - NVIDIA will be submitting talks (Erik, Ralph, Rick)
            - Erik: dispatching, how to work on backends
            - Ralph, Rick: nx-cugraph use cases
    - Data Science Salon, NYC
        - https://www.datascience.salon/newyork/

- ArangoDB working on updating nx-arangodb to take advantage of new dispatchable Graph functions
    - add/remove nodes, etc.
    - current implementation that uses dictionary factories results in on API call per update

- installing backend(nx-parallel) after importing networkx --> does not update config (figured while creating demo for Pyconf Hyderabad)
    - reloading configs
    - functions like: `remove_backend`(removing it from the configs and ep) - helpful if setting configs for a backend might slow down the importing of networkx and the user doesn't even use that backend in their code, `update_backends`(or `reload_config`)
- can we simplify installing backends for users inside(or via) networkx? --> like storing(and then later running) the install instructions in the `networkx.backend_info` ep? but the backend should be already installed to load the ep!
    - something like `nx.install_backend("backend_name")`

- Any new or interesting use cases for backends/dispatching?
    - integrations with LangChain
    - kuzudb integration

- CookieCutter backend (similar to Aditi's J4F) is something NX core devs have been asking for
    - Aditi suggested this could this be a good GSOC project(+ dispatching tutorial nb or gallery eg - for users), and that she, Dan, others could mentor.
    - [ToDo] Aditi mentioned she'd add this to the list of GSOC projects.

- Any updates needed to NX 3.5?
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7768
    - Can we coordinate with Google Colab to have them update to 3.5 soon after it's released?
    - https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7760

- Notes on using nx-arangodb
    ```
    docker run --name arango -p 8529:8529 -e ARANGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=test arangodb/arangodb:3.12.4

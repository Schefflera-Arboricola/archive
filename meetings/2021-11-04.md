## PR review

There are a couple quick merges (I think) that need a second set of :eyes:
 - [x] [#5153: Fix bug in multipartite layout](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5153)
 - [ ] [#5086: Fix bug in lowest_common_ancestors](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5086)
   * This one may have an interesting opportunity for a little research project if anyone's interested. See the discussion in #4942, particularly [here](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4942#issuecomment-873127745)

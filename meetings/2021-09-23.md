## Topics

 - Accessibility of documentation
   * Something that projects are focusing on more: https://discuss.scientific-python.org/t/discussion-accessible-open-source-projects/63
     - Many considerations are for upstream tools (e.g. docs theme - by using `pandas-sphinx-theme` we're already benefitting from the work they've done)
     - There are other recommendations, such as adding alt-text to images, that projects themselves can undertake to improve accessibility.
   * Do we have any questions/comments about accessibility?
   
 - NumFOCUS' [response to our fiscal sponsorship questions](https://hackmd.io/M66O6JkXSY2AQ7TJa6HD7w). Next steps:
   * Do we have any further follow-up questions?
   * If not, and we're happy with the current state of affairs, we have to sign something (I think by/in October - will figure out the dates)
   * Longer term: investigate other sponsorship programs?
   
 - [GraphBLAS](https://graphblas.github.io/) - seems like an interesting project for supporting different computational "backends"
   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphBLAS
   * They have a python wrapper too - https://github.com/Graphegon/pygraphblas
     * Also https://github.com/metagraph-dev/grblas
   * Can all graph algorithms be implemented in terms of linear algebra?
       * It is known that DFS is rather difficult to implement on linear algebra, but https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3315454.3329962
   * [Algorithms that use the GraphBLAS](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/LAGraph)
   * https://graphxd.github.io/_downloads/2018-03-27-buluc.pdf
   * https://github.com/GraphBLAS/python-suitesparse-graphblas
* Another interesting library to keep a track of https://github.com/metagraph-dev/metagraph
  * https://github.com/metagraph-dev/mlir-graphblas ([MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) is extensible compiler infrastructure)
   
 - Deprecating `name` parameter from `union` function

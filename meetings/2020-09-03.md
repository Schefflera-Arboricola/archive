# NetworkX Developer Discussions:  September 3rd, 2020

In attendance: Jarrod Millman, Dan Schult, Mridul Seth, Kelly Boothby, Stefan van der Walt

## Topics

- Welcome and news 

- Roadmap:
    - update on pygraphviz:  Looks like Graphviz isn't confident in the library interface beyond cgraph. They suggest sticking with the command line interface. What are the down sides to doing that?  What makes command line hard for installation, building wheels, and CI scripts on nonunix based systems?
      * https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1808
    - Geospatial data
      -  https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas/issues/1592
    - generator/create_using interface
      * Past discussion at [#1393](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/1393) and [#3036](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/3036)
      * Inefficient to construct a Graph if we only need the edges.  [How inefficient?]
      * Current generators don't allow starting from an existing graph. [But can now use G.update(nx.path_graph(nodes))]
      * Confusion about create_using being a factory or a graph instance. [Could make it always a factory in v3.0]
      * decorators make it pretty easy to create a graph factory, or an edge generator and build an object that can return either edges-and-nodes, Graph, DiGraph, etc for the user.
      * In last week's chat from Kelly Boothby : one possibly annoying suggestion: give length=1 tuples for isolated nodes?(a,b), (c,) which makes handling it annoyingly edge-casey and add_edges_from will hate it
 From Kelly Boothby : Three issues: graph data, node data, edge data : Some generators populate a name, for example
14:17:52	 From Kelly Boothby : This beast populates node data:  https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave_networkx/blob/master/dwave_networkx/generators/pegasus.py
      * Thoughts from Dan Schult about Chat topic: 
      Base info type on length and dict-notdict inspection:
      length 1, dict-like:  G.graph.update()
      length 1, notdict-like:  isolated node
      length 2, 2nd dict-like: isolated node + data
      length 2, notdict-like: edge 2-tuple
      length 3, 3rd dict-like: edge +data
      length 3, notdict-like: multiedge with key
      length 4, 4th dict-like: multiedge with key and data
      e.g. graph_stream = [{'name'="fred"}, (c,), (a, b), (d, {'color':'red'}), (d, b, {'capacity':5}), (a, b, 'k'), (a, b, 'j', {'capacity':3})]

    - thoughts about matrix data structure: csgraph/pyData.sparse/Scipy.sparse interface.
      * Ross: still haven't read anything yet, but Stefan/Jarrod pinged Hameer (`pydata.sparse` maintainer) and unfortunately pydata.sparse doesn't magically solve our problems because they are still relying on conversion through `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` for linalg ops.
    - dependencies? 
      * Jarrod's (potentially controversial) idea:
        - Background: Currently very minimal requests for non-CPython implementations (Jython, IronPython, PyPy)
          * PyPy: focused on 2.7, support for newer Python 3 versions (>3.6) is spotty and/or non-existent. Potentially leaving the software conservancy group?
        - Proposal: Turn our dependencies (numpy, scipy, lxml, etc) into hard dependencies
          * Removes boilerplate code related to conditional imports
      * General consensus: okay to submit a PR for review!
    - cython in ticket what implications? https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4169
        This week sounded like not much support for including cython .pyx files in the repo.
        But some interest in have a separate repo for sped up code.  e.g. `nx-turbofuncs`
        - Could also speed up a bunch of code that hasn't been looked at in a long time.
        - Could make sure that functions where one is matrix based and one isn't (like PageRank)
          that we make sure the faster one is the one users actually use.
        Some criteria:
            - adheres to a defined API,
            - is labelled "experimental",
            - includes pure Python implementation,
            - has contact information for original contributor so that they can be contributed,
            - released on a separate schedule from NetworkX
            - We have consensus on this one.
            - Includes benchmarks (with a pure-Python implementation as the baseline)

- networkx-metis
  - https://pypi.org/project/metis/
  - https://pypi.org/project/metis-python/

- update on CI using gh-actions
  * Experimenting with pygraphviz - seems very easy to do minus GraphViz installation on Windows (Ross will followup with GraphViz folks)
  * Mridul: recently set up the black/linting github-action for another project
    - Link to gh-action config: https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/blob/14d2477f165dafca6ea1d5ef1da2e9139ad00258/.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml 

- Speed Benchmarks:   We could compare ourselves to other packages on common routines like: Benchmark done by Tiago(Graph-Tool) https://graph-tool.skewed.de/performance, another one https://github.com/timlrx/graph-benchmarks 


Could we use the Friday coding time to get some code audit done? Or spend 30 mimnutes of Thursday talking about things people could do on a Friday.
We decided to make next week's meeting focus on looking at code for helpful tasks -- Might end up with half/half but for next week, let's try coding. In meantime come up with things to look at.



Readthedocs may provide a count of how many doc pages are viewed...  ??google analytics for our functions?

=============================================
13:07:15	 From JARROD MILLMAN : https://hackmd.io/ea2IhUuqSrG4kM9tokXuEw
13:37:17	 From Mridul Seth : The scipy one is 4x faster than pure python.
13:38:10	 From Mridul Seth : https://github.com/timlrx/graph-benchmarks/issues/9
13:40:35	 From Stefan van der Walt : Since May 2018, the C extension support in PyPy is good enough to run NumPy and SciPy, apparently.
13:41:20	 From Kelly Boothby : https://pypi.org/project/metis/
13:41:24	 From Kelly Boothby : https://pypi.org/project/metis-python/
13:45:11	 From Stefan van der Walt : With the NumPy team, we keep running notes throughout the week, and then we use the meeting to discuss any items that stand out or sound interesting---that way we get to skip over most of it.

I like the 30 min working together idea.
13:46:34	 From Mridul Seth : Oh btw, we are officially into PyData Global for a NetworkX sprint.
13:47:00	 From Stefan van der Walt : Nice!
13:49:19	 From Mridul Seth : There is a conda one https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/networkx-metis
13:49:30	 From Mridul Seth : This is the networkx/networkx-metis one
13:54:39	 From Stefan van der Walt : https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/
13:55:26	 From Mridul Seth : https://github.com/networkx/networkx/graphs/traffic maybe have a look here ? (I don’t have the right permissions)
13:57:52	 From Kelly Boothby : this lists repos that depend on us: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS01MjMzNzI3NA%3D%3D
13:59:08	 From Mridul Seth : https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#traffic

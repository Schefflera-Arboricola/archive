In attendance: Dan, Jarrod, Kelly, Mridul, Ross, Camille

## Welcome and news

:tada: Happy new year :tada: 

- NumFOCUS fiscal sponsorship agreement
  * The plan: copy the FSA so that we can all comment/discuss internally.

## Topics

- Lazy imports: Stefan has worked up in scikit-image: https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/5101
  * Comments from Jon Crall + tooling in `mkinit`
- Pygraphviz 1.7
  * rc out - improved installation procedure
- Meeting with `igraph` developers - Monday 1/11/21 12PM PST
  * Discuss collaboration ideas, graph visualization, etc.

Merge/discuss PRs:
- [ ] https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4221
- [ ] https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4451 (doc + tests for arbitrary element)
     * Think more about this one
- [ ] https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4454 (generate_unique_node)
     * Review instances of `generate_unique_node` individually


Review of test suite and coverage:
- [ ] https://codecov.io/gh/networkx/networkx/src/master/networkx/algorithms/swap.py
- [ ] https://codecov.io/gh/networkx/networkx/src/master/networkx/algorithms/isomorphism/temporalisomorphvf2.py
- [ ] Testing for Union, compose, Euler path

## Discussion

 - **Performance and Benchmarking**
   * Start a GitHub discussion to collect/get feedback from users
   * One idea: select a single algorithm (e.g. shortest path) and implement w/ e.g. Cython (already in scipy `csgraph`), CPython, Pythran (+transonic?) to evaluate performance
     - Develop a set of inputs that encompass graphs with various properties (sparsity, size (nodes, edges), etc.)
   * Also need to compare against different libraries

## Notes from last week (no discussion)

- Topic for Kelly:
  - Make an effort to connect with D-wave's algorithms... at least make the API similar-or same.

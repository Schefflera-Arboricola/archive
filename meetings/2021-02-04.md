## PRs that need an opinion

- https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4594
  Do we always want to build docs even when they're not modified?  Maybe, to see the gallery, e.g.
  But can at least avoid running tests in response to docs-only changes.

- https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/4315#issuecomment-772964321
  Request for an algorithm that the requester later said they found in NX.
  *Dan closed thisâ€”thanks, Dan!*

## Discussion

 - A groups.io email group for core devs
   - **Action item**: create groups.io group (Jarrod)
 
 - NX website landing page logo: add a more complex/meaningful graph? Ideas?
 
 - Other gallery examples
 - As many examples to other visualization libraries as possible
    * graphtool?
    * igraph (WIP)

 - **Action item**: Add a "visualization" category to GitHub discussions
   * Add the above bullet: projects we'd like gallery examples for
   * Add a bullet about gotchas/questions related to visualization
     - let's people know we're thinking about visualization
     - Good place to collect ideas for NXEPs/design docs etc.

# NetworkX Developer Discussions: Â August 20th, 2020

In attendance: Jarrod, Dan, Mridul, Stefan, Ross

## Topics

- Welcome and news
- Release Schedule Update
- NXEP process -- how to keep these moving?
  * Lots of busy people these days... hopefully more focused attention soon
  * Perhaps an NXEP sprint some time in the future?
- Use tidelift as a funding source for outreachy/outreach activities? NumPy/SciPy are part of it (@Ross can you confirm this?). Apparently networkx could get around 600-700$/month https://tidelift.com/lifter/search/conda/networkx, https://tidelift.com/lifter/search/pypi/networkx
- Move `pre-commit` formatting stuff to a GitHub action? https://github.com/pre-commit/action
   - No more black/flake8/pre-commit dependencies for users, formatting changes all applied via CI
   - Investigate possibilities (Ross)

- Roadmap

    1. weighted edges allow functions throughout. 
        How to handle default values especially for strings which don't have any associated attributes. We should raise an exception in this case, but how best to track it? We don't want to check on every lookup. So does checking become a separate function?
    2. sparse data structure vs matrix vs array.  
       Last time: pyData.sparse (??) might be a better interface to a sparse array structure.
    3. NX Turbo data structure/functions for speed.

  [Nice comment from #1076](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/1076#issuecomment-37876456)

  Maybe we could use a Turbo decorator?
  Tied into how we generate graphs
  https://github.com/UDST/pandana
      - Also a good place to discuss the "Network Science forum (discourse)"
    5. graph/edge generators. What is wrong with current create_using? 
        - Past discussion at [#1393](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/1393) and [#3036](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/3036)
        - Inefficient to construct a Graph if we only need the edges.
        - Current generators don't allow starting from an existing graph. 
        - Confusion about create_using being a factory or a graph instance.
        - Some competing interfaces:
          ```python
          nx.path_graph(N, create_using=nx.MultiGraph())
          nx.MultiGraph(nx.generate_path(N))
          nx.path_graph.multigraph(N)
          G.update(nx.path_graph(N))
          ```
        - For obtaining edge generators:
          ```python
          nx.path_graph(N).edges()
          nx.path_graph.edges_and_nodes(N)
          nx.path_generator(N)
          ```
        
    5. EdgeDataView has no "contains" dunder function. Should it?  If so, the getitem keys should match contains. And iter should iterate over all those keys.
       Whatever happens with EdgeDataView, NodeDataView ought to do the same. It current allowed contains but requires a match of both node and data.
    6. Other topics/ API issues?

## Followup from last week

 - Sprint followup
   * Hackmd from sprint 1: https://hackmd.io/s7IdLCGOQByr-kS0HvxtPg
   * Related: PyData global sprint? Developer vs. new contributor sprints?

 - Label maintenance
   * Maintenance seems too generic (documentation? enhancement?)
   * Are "enhancement" and "new feature" close enough to be one tag?
     - Currently [27 open issues/PRs](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/labels). Replace with "enhancement" and delete the label?
   * Can "needs review" be replaced by the standard workflow for pull requests?
     - Currently 12 issues/PRs with this label. Review these, assign to reviewers, & delete the label?

   * **TODO** - work on moving from appveyor to github actions for windows
     - Add dependency installation (numpy/scipy/pygraphviz) to windows

## Discussion

- NetworkX PyData sprint (Mridul submitted)
  * Should hear when talks are released

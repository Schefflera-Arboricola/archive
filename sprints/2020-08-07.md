# NetworkX Sprint

- Note from Eric: I will be joining closer to 1 pm; I have to coordinate lunchtime with my wife, who is also working.

**What:** An informal, virtual code sprint on [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx)!

**Who:** Any and all people who are interested in the `networkx` Python package; network science in general; and/or scientific computing in any capacity. We welcome people from all levels of experience and interest!

**Where:** Online via zoom[^1]: https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/97535087515?pwd=NENmOGZZV3laQjR2MnRsVWpzRVhkUT09 

**When**: Friday, Aug. 7th @ 9AM - 12PM PDT ([see this in your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=NetworkX+Sprint&iso=20200807T09&p1=224&ah=3))

Not sure what to do but itching to get working on something? Here's a list of [sprintable issues](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ASprint) from the NetworkX issue tracker.

### How will this work?

From from 9AM - 12PM PDT on Friday Aug. 7th, some core developers from the NetworkX project will be hanging out online in the video channel linked above. Anyone who is interested in NetworkX and network science are invited to join us. The idea is to get interested folks together to ask/answer questions, discuss project ideas, and, of course, to write code for NetworkX! How we will actually spend the time depends entirely on the interests of the attendees.

### Topics

Please add...

1. the matrix form is currently not consistent -- sometimes we return a scipy.sparse matrix and other times a numpy array (dense matrix). Can we make this better? Is there a reason to provide both options eveyrwhere? Or stick to one. see #4089
2. Can we find ways to onboard newcomers more efficiently? Will Peppo, whom I know from LinkedIn, will be joining in the call, and has some ideas to share and possibly put in a PR for. see #4089 as well
3. It'd be nice to have weighted edges handled the same throughout the package. Currenlty we sometimes use a string to denote the edge attribute and sometimes (started in weighted shortest_paths) we provide either a string or a function which could compute the weights on the fly. There is a `_weight_function()` function defined in weighted.py that processes the input and provides a function for the algorithm to use.  PR #4085 is a good start toward implementing this function interface more broadly using decorators.
4. Currently NodeDataView and NodeView and EdgeView are subscriptable but EdgeDataView is not. Can we get that to work? 

### Discussions

 - Great feedback/ideas on organizing sprints, encouraging contributors, etc (thanks @willpeppo!)
   * Community engagement - "ambassador" role? Someone to help map contributors to things they can help on in a more hands-on fashion (mentoring)
   * Applying "triage" principle to contributors - map contributors based on their level to appropriate issues. For example - if a contributor is trying to learn how to code, then a small issue/change that focuses on using GitHub etc. may be appropriate.
   * Include a pre-sprint Orientation for newer contributors - e.g. do a screen share that walks through the development process for an issue
   * An interesting observation: have to look at the contribution guide from multiple (e.g. 5) OSS projects to get a good idea of general best-practices for development
